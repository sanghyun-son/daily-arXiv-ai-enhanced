Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data.

Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o.

Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in\nretrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but\nalso performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and\ndomain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nopened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the\nmodel ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is\nmost relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate\nsuch capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce\nFinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with\nmulti-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The\nbenchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms\nand assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document\ntype among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected\ndocument.

We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from\nIsraeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three\ncomplexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,\nand reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results\nshowed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base\nperformance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly\n(52.9% for Meditron-70B).

In contrast, our multi-agent\nframework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive\nfunctions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,\nand validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range\nmodels. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus\n69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity\nquestions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty\nperformance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning\nchallenges that persisted with RAG enhancement.

Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing\n(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system\nrequirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical\nexperiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our\nmain findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to\ndomain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry\nrequirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while\nissues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data\npreprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly\nconducted by humans rather than automated methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) \ub3c4\uc785 \uc2e4\ud0dc\ub97c 13\uba85\uc758 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790 \ubc18\uad6c\uc870\ud654 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d, \uc2e4\ubb34 \uacfc\uc81c \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "RAG\uac00 LLM \ucd9c\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568.", "method": "\ubc18\uad6c\uc870\ud654 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0(13\uba85\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 RAG\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840, \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d, \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \uad00\ud589\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\u00b7\ubd84\uc11d.", "result": "\uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c\ub294 RAG\uc758 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \uc801\uc6a9\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c QA\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \uc218\uc900\uc784, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\u00b7\ubcf4\uc548\u00b7\ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc774\uba70 \uc724\ub9ac\u00b7\ud3b8\ud5a5\u00b7\ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub35c \uace0\ub824\ub428, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub428.", "conclusion": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub824\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00, \uc724\ub9ac\u00b7\ud3b8\ud5a5\u00b7\ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ub300\uc751 \ub4f1 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ud559\uacc4\u00b7\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uac04 \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \ud45c\uc900\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "relevance": "High"}}

Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested.

Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in\npoor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized\nas one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple\nlocal updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift\narises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied\nwell. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients\nat each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that\ndeviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift\nsince the optimization objective shifts with every round.\n  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client\ndrift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on\ncross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases.

Post-training quantization\n(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language\nModels (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced\ngeneralization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a\n16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLLM(\ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc758 PTQ \uc801\uc6a9 \uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 PTQ \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(DLLMQuant)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\ubc95\uc740 TMAS, IA-AQ, CGQ\uc774\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\ud638\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DLLM\uc740 \ube44\uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\u00b7\uc5f0\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ucee4 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 PTQ\ub97c DLLM\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4(\uc608: W4A4\uc5d0\uc11c AWQ\ub294 LLADA \uae30\uc900 16% \uac10\uc18c).

Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs", "comment": "Accepted at ICSR25", "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have\nopened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of\nautonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative\nreasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or\nknows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision.

However, existing\nmethods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require\nclients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally\nexpensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side\nfiltering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that\nreduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes\nthe need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based\ndensity ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality\nof knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,\nincluding strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,\nwithout requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge\ndistillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID\nscenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The\nsignificantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is\nsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing\nthe scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation.

Urban\nflooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,\nthreatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making\nremains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among\ncompeting goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)\nrequires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental\nconditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies\nfrequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.\nExisting methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent\ncoordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates\nknowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven\noptimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from\nmulti-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement.

Additionally,\nprior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales\nthat fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In\nthis work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition\nbenchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple\nground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more\ncomprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of\nprevious approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)\nframework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image\nembeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,\nour framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict\naccurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on\nthe multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong\nzero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy\nand rationale quality.

Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving\nprimarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support\nmulti-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and\nsemantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous\ndriving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different\nmodalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not\nleverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this\nproblem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video\ngeneration approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified\ndiffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and\nmodal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to\nencode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion\nmodel for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is\ncapable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified\nframework.

This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational\nprinciple of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need\nto match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite\nthe importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive\nstudies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension\ndifficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of\nChinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading\ncomprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade\nteachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers\nnationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot\nlearning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of\nrandom guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance\nimproves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy\nof their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging\nabilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in\ntheir current training for educationally aligned judgment.

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable\nof handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle\ntracking in complex traffic scenes.

In addition, we introduce a new benchmark\ndataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking\nannotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused\ntracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\napproach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and\nseveral public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose\nobject tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class\ntracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with\nHOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

An adaptation method\nfits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative\nmodel initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image\ngeneration ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly\nwhen processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and\ncultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.\nExisting approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or\nfinetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally\nspecific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address\nthis issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic\nunderstanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.\nExisting approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require\na massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics.

First, we encode poses\nusing bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to\nimprove the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we\nintroduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic\nsimilarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,\naiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey\nrelevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss\nalone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT\nbaseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves\na 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error.

The quality of this reconstruction\nserves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing\nwith LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model.

Although Selective State Space Models\n(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,\nthe spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional\nmodeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence\nthrough temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose\nthe Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the\nlatest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce\nSpatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points\ninto semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby\nenabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally\ndistant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion\ndetails, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates\nspatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction\nwithin the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances\nfine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and\nexpanded receptive fields.

Existing approaches suffer from two key\nlimitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and\ndata-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while\nlarge language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural\nlanguage interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical\nreasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our\napproach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex\ndependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph\nattention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured\nembeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via\nreinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input\ncharacteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework\noperates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,\ndynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and\nprojecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to\ngenerate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three\ntasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised\nand zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers\ncompetitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing\nstrong generalization and cross-task adaptability.

Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting\ngeneral features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio\ncontains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically\nstruggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face\nwhen trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking\nhead image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that\nconstructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial\nMotion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute\ndeformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and\npersonalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss\nfunction during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,\nwe integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating\nblurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization\nwith limited training data.

However, license plate areas in dash cam\nimages often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make\naccurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on\npretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently\nintroducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose\na novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,\nMF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and\naggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To\nachieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow\nestimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and\ncorrect erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal\nconsistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances\nboth image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential\ncontent of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR\n(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of\nlow-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth\nimages, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,\nMF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,\nand LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an\naccuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and\nthe multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models.

Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in\nnarrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or\nrely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that\ncompromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,\nsubject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for\ncustomization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject\nfine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated\ncondition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an\nadaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales\nand attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and\nits surrounding context.

First, we develop a novel data\nsynthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest\nchains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex\nmulti-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private\nmedical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate\nmedical information synthesis.

To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the\npretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual\nconcepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture\nand temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the\ncontrol architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector\nthat filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their\npropagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector\nemploying a dual-branch design.

To explore this\nfuture, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,\nand society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D\nscenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at\nscale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans\ndevelop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how\nintelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,\nVirtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator\nthat supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A\nlarge-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast\noutdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with\nrich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines.

Beyond sampling\nefficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to\nkeep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated\ngrowth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent\napproaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and\nlanguage, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization\ncapabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing\napproaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a\nhierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such\ndesigns are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally\ndiversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a\nframework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously\ncompile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast\nneural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the\nhigh-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the\nhigh-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and\ngeneralization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space.

However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal\ndynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and\nenvironmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To\naddress these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor\narrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature\nrepresentations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase\nUncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke\ndetection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via\noptical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is\nperformed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set\nfractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The\nresulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a\nGaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke\nregions.

These methods require training on vast amounts of data\nusually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most\ninstitutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other\nhand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific\ndata, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is\ntransferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly\nvaluable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the\ndevelopment of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new\nmodel-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and\npreservation.

Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation\nstrategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating\nknowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.\nBy unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit\nteachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.\nOur model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently\nsupports multiple downstream tasks.

RAW images\nalso incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral\nproperties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature\nof RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning\nmethods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range\nof illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and\nthe ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the\nburden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the\nfirst-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide\nrange of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable\nillumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our\nillumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,\nand 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network\napproach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing\nmethods.

Luber"], "title": "Adversarial Hospital-Invariant Feature Learning for WSI Patch Classification", "comment": "8 pages,6 figures", "summary": "Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in\nwhole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different\nhospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing\nstyles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,\nposing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first\nsystematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source\ncharacteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying\ndomain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple\nmodels, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent\nhospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the\nencoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier\nconnected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns\ntask-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations.

To\nalleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained\nfeatures for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve\nperformance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine\nobjectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,\nincluding contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for\ntraining is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which\nis designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in\ncaptions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the\noriginal captions, referred to as \"Repetition\", can enhance retrieval\nperformance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this\ninsight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates\na voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better\nretrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental\nresults on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nprevious approaches.

For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by\ntraining models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using\nspecialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more\nefficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are\nadapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust\ngeneralization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when\nexposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these\ndesign choices influence generalization remains an open question with\nsignificant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study\nspanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3\nadaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200\nrobustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this\nis the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.\nWhile attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are\nincreasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in\na supervised manner on large datasets often perform best.

The complexity is heightened by three key\nfactors: 1) \\emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \\emph{The\nintricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \\emph{The myriad\ncorrelations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.\n  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a\nself-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a\nnovel \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{S}elf-learning framework for\n\\underline{S}patio-\\underline{T}emporal data (\\model). Our approach initiates\nwith the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and\ntheir respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to\nexploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped\nprediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph\nfrom similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is\nfine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data.

Recently, EEG foundation\nmodels (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer\narchitectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language\nmodels (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG\ndata, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large\nmodels often incurred high computational costs during both training and\ninference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.\nIn this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon\nGenerative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured\nstate-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the\ntemporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were\nthen used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion\ntransformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple\nUniversity EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art\napproaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method\noutperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.\nThese findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current\nFMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "EEGDM\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud655\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 EEG \ud45c\ud604\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378(SSMDP)\uc744 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc5bb\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 Latent Fusion Transformer(LFT)\ub85c downstream \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, real-world user interactions are\ninfluenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand\naffinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail\nto capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with\nactual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across\nthe ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling\nuser behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,\nfirst trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item\npermutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize\npredicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling\nend-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To\naddress the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen\npermutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\\textit{KD-Eval}$,\nusing a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)\n$\\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language\nmodels. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the\nAmazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior\ndynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

To learn\nrobust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution\nAware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR)\nthat can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically,\nconsidering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs\na probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user\nand item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI).\nAdditionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions\nas prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item\ndistributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin\ninterests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of\nusers or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting\nexisting multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust\nrepresentations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4 \uace0\uc720 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378(GSVR)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubd84\ud3ec \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\ud56d \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\u00b7\uc544\uc774\ud15c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc774 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac16\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud574 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\u00b7\uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860(VI) \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\ud56d \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804(prior)\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubc0f \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub4e4\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uaddc\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c GSVR\uc744 \uae30\uc874 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ub354 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ucd94\ucc9c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GSVR\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 \uc2ec\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubd84\ud3ec \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uac8c \ud574, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Medium"}}

Finally, the paper discusses future\nresearch directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral\ndisparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to\nprovide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and\ntrustworthy human-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \ud750\ub824\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc2e0\ub8b0\u00b7\ucc45\uc784\u00b7\ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \u2018Network Behavior Lifecycle\u2019(6\ub2e8\uacc4)\uacfc \u2018Agent for Agent(A4A)\u2019\u00b7\u2018Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity(HABD)\u2019 \ubaa8\ub378(5\uac1c \ucc28\uc6d0)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ub808\ub4dc\ud300/\ube14\ub8e8\ud300 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ud654\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc, \ucc45\uc784 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\uc131, \uc724\ub9ac\u00b7\ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c \ub4f1\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 6\ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\ub204\ub294 'Network Behavior Lifecycle'\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c 5\uac1c \ucc28\uc6d0(\uacb0\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728, \uc758\ub3c4-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\uc131, \ube44\ud569\ub9ac\uc131 \ud328\ud134)\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 'HABD' \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f 'A4A' \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub808\ub4dc\ud300(\uacf5\uaca9)\u00b7\ube14\ub8e8\ud300(\ubc29\uc5b4) \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\u00b7\uc815\ub7c9\ud654\u00b7\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc744 \ub17c\uc758.", "result": "HABD\uc640 A4A\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4, \ud589\ub3d9 \uaca9\ucc28 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654, \uba54\ud0c0 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ub4f1 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uae30\uc220 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548\u00b7\ucc45\uc784\u00b7\uc724\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ucd9c\ubc1c\uc810\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Medium"}}

The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by\ntheir computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing\nstrategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods\nhave been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation\nbetween skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot\nprocess large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy\npoints, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on\nregistration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread\napplicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based\ncoarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated\ncorrespondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud\ntransformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network\nand a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second\nstages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point\nmovement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood\nprecision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric\nstructures (edges, orientations and relative position features).

However, their\ntheoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains\nunderexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a\ncontrolled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align\nwith our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical\nunderstanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,\nand provides practical guidance for designing effective models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc6a9 SDE \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\ub960\uc801(score-based) \uc0dd\uc131\ubaa8\ub378(SGGM)\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\uc810\uadfc\uc801(non-asymptotic) \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c \ubcf5\uc218\uc758 coupled SDE\ub85c \uae30\uc220\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c \uae30\uc874 SGM \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uace0, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624(\uace0\uc815 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc0dd\uc131, \uace0\uc815 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131, \ub450 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc2dc \uc0dd\uc131)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc218\ub834 \uc0c1\ud55c(\uc0dd\uc131 \uc624\ucc28 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c)\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \ub4f1 SGGMs\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc720\ud55c \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\ub834\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc2a4\ud15d, \ud655\uc0b0 \uae38\uc774 \uac19\uc740 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ub4f1 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uad8c\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SGGM\uc740 \uc57d\ubb3c\ubc1c\uacac, \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ud569\uc131 \ub4f1 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uae30\uc874 SGM\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131 \uc774\ub860\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 SGGMs\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SGGM\uc744 \ubcf5\uc218\uc758 \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c SDE \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4\ub85c \ube44\uc810\uadfc\uc801 \uc218\ub834 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0, \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130(\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc2a4\ud15d, \ud655\uc0b0 \uae38\uc774) \uc601\ud5a5 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uac19\uc740 \uac1c\uc120 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc624\ucc28\uc758 \ube44\uc810\uadfc\uc801 \uc218\ub834 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5c8\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud2b9\uc774\uc131(\uc608: \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0)\uc774 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce68\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc640 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 \uc218\ub834 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9ac\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801/\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SGGMs\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\uc810\uadfc\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Medium"}}

However, the exact\ncomputation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,\nseverely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The\nchallenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as\nin Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather\nthan point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling\nhigher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class\nof GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and\ninteractions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global\nexplanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise\nexplanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components\nand compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,\ncapturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global\nexplanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and\ncompute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the\nmodel's overall sensitivity.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce \\textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset\nencompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,\nand LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.\nBy integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial\nbotanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum.

While numerous methods have\nbeen proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to\nnon-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of\nthese methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this\npaper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our\nbenchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports\na wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that\nenables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate\nrepresentative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,\nand reinforcement learning-based approaches.

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from\nreference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with\nhighly flexible illumination control.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs\ncan exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.\nMoreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and\nmessage-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias\nby filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge\ndropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may\nunintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised\nbalance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we\npresent a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias\nmitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using\ncounterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node\nrepresentations learning from the augmented graph.

Meanwhile,\ndiffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on\ntext prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder\naccurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce\nGSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in\nunder-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models\ninto 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene\ndetails. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our\ncustomized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to\nadapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact\ntypes from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair\nfor unseen camera poses.

The proposed technique addresses the\nlimitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues\nlike equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By\ncombining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object\ndetection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D\nbounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and\nrotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to\nlocate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods\n(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image\ncoordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to\nhomography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold\nof 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows\nthe creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a\npublicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box\nannotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach.

However, prior methods typically decouple geometry\nand motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then\nestimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates\nthe reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects\nwith complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation\nthat jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This\nformulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports\narticulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior\napproaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.\nTo systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a\nnew benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each\nwith diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry\nreconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types.

The proposed methodology\nintegrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived\nfrom reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for\nrigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve\n(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the\nefficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),\nBidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).\nAll the models achieved \"out-of-sample\" production forecasts for an upcoming\nfuture timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using\ntraditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and\nPrediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing\ncapabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input\ndimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The\nuncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a\ndistribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,\n95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a\ndistinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for\ncomplex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the\nLSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample\nforecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well\nE1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining\ndomain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the\nreliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": "", "relevance": ""}}

In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional\nRGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex\ntemporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To\naddress this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN\nframework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos.

Specifically, the method computes the average\nobject size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the\nnormalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the\nassociation stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain\nrobust and consistent object trajectories.
