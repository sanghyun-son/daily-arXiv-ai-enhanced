Predicting students at risk\nof dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning\n(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent\nin student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether\ntransforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using\nclustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the\nperformance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)\non these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest\n(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments\nexplore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering\nalgorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques\n(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and\nProjection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,\nGraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior\nperformance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage\npoints and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular\nbaseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction\nmethods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical\nrole of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This\nhighlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally\ntransforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

The proposed methodology\nintegrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived\nfrom reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for\nrigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve\n(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the\nefficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),\nBidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).\nAll the models achieved \"out-of-sample\" production forecasts for an upcoming\nfuture timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using\ntraditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and\nPrediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing\ncapabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input\ndimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The\nuncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a\ndistribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,\n95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a\ndistinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for\ncomplex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the\nLSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample\nforecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well\nE1H.

Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in\nretrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but\nalso performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and\ndomain-specific knowledge.

However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate\nsuch capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce\nFinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with\nmulti-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The\nbenchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms\nand assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document\ntype among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected\ndocument. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning\nsteps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a\nquantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.\nWe evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how\ntargeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.\nOur benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior\nin complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.

For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by\ntraining models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using\nspecialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more\nefficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are\nadapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust\ngeneralization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when\nexposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these\ndesign choices influence generalization remains an open question with\nsignificant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study\nspanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3\nadaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200\nrobustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this\nis the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.\nWhile attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are\nincreasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in\na supervised manner on large datasets often perform best.

However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous\nlearning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is\noverwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the\nhuman brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided\nby processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of\nlearned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a\nsleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found\nthat SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in\ncontinuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC\nimplemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model\n(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks\nincorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP\nperformed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)\nwhen both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models\non the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\nCombining SRC with rehearsal, also known as \"awake replay\", further boosted the\nnetwork's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new\ntasks.

Data with such volume and\ncomplexity needs to be compressed before storing and transmitting efficiently.\nData compression has gained significant attention from modern researchers,\nresulting in the development of fast and efficient compression algorithms such\nas Gzip. However, since gzip works on the principle of repetition of binary\npatterns, one of the limitations of gzip is that domain-specific formats like\nJSON, XML, HTML, and log files, while structured, may have semantic repetition\nbut not syntactic repetition, which gzip finds difficult to compress. In this\narticle, we propose a GPT-based preprocessor for such domain-specific files. We\npropose a pipeline made up of GPT-2 taking domain-specific files as input,\nwhich pattern-based compressors like gzip find difficult to work on. The\npreprocessor results are output in a file that is designed for compressors like\ngzip. After preprocessing, the gzip works on the other end of the pipeline and\ncompresses the data as usual.

This paper\naffirmatively answers the question with a set of \\emph{myopic} (finite\nvisibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \\emph{filling a minimal\nvertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special\nvertices, called \\emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially.\nStarting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of\nvertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous\n($\\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the\n\\emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \\cite{Karp1972} for\ngeneral graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We\nestablish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time\ncomplexity (which is $\\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one\nfor single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for\nmultiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the\nnumber of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on\ntrees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present\ntwo algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors\nwith an extra memory of $O(\\log \\Delta)$ for the robots, where $\\Delta$ is the\nmaximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Recently, EEG foundation\nmodels (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer\narchitectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language\nmodels (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG\ndata, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large\nmodels often incurred high computational costs during both training and\ninference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.\nIn this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon\nGenerative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured\nstate-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the\ntemporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model.

However, real-world user interactions are\ninfluenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand\naffinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail\nto capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with\nactual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across\nthe ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling\nuser behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,\nfirst trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item\npermutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize\npredicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling\nend-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To\naddress the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen\npermutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\\textit{KD-Eval}$,\nusing a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)\n$\\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language\nmodels. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the\nAmazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior\ndynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

Sharding is considered a\npromising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing\nblockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of\navailability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data\nunavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded\nblockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of\nmultiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local\nchain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism\nacross multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph\n(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable\nefficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or\ncross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively\nexecutes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high\nparallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,\nPyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions\nin the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to\nmitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to\nlower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,\ndemonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and\n2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical\nsharded blockchain."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

While traditional anomaly detection methods\nprimarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at\nhome at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in\ncollective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home\nalone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.\nUnlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling\nspatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative\nsampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.\nThis leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that\nexplicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative\nsampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference\nscores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly\ninformative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a\ndiverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity\nfrom the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator\ncombines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more\neffective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative\nand diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve\ntheir generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to\nmaximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also\nhave to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to\nreject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an\ninput sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a\ntransaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected\n(entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$\ncooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a\ndecision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating\nand augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our\nmain contribution is an $\\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the\nproblem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the\ndistribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{p})$.

Current methods typically use a unified framework to\noffer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often\nemploy shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's\ncapacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should\nexhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to\nlearn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet,\nvariations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity\nissues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn\nrobust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution\nAware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR)\nthat can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically,\nconsidering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs\na probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user\nand item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI).\nAdditionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions\nas prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item\ndistributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin\ninterests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of\nusers or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting\nexisting multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust\nrepresentations."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit\nHypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns\nfixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end\nmanner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we\nintroduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model\nefficiently.

Growing interest in scalable and\nreusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological\ngeneralization, the ability of control policies to cope with different\nkinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and\neffective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these\narchitectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region\nmethods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To\nthis end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy\noptimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)\nand its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality\ninfluence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints\nimposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the\ntheoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is\ncarried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment.

Recent\nresearch focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising\nway is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,\nlifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling\nmethods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and\ncandidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to\nutilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the\nother hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,\npotentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these\nproblems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal\ninformation and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based\nretrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong\nSequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal\nlifelong sequence modeling module.

Thus,\nrecommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into\naccount user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of\nsuch complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a\nnew paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search\nscenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,\nan end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as\nthere are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make\nfull use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance\nmultiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and\nstores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we\npropose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different\nperspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic\ninformation for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder\nleverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)\nneighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for\ngeneration. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and\npropose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the\nabove design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In\nfact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves\n400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in\nterms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

For example, Virtustream introduced so-called muVMs to charge\ncloud computing resources while other providers such as Google, Microsoft, or\nAmazon re-invented their marketspaces. Today, the market leader Amazon runs six\nmarketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of\nvirtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces\nand providers. An industry-relevant field of research is to identify best\npractices and guidelines on how such optimal portfolios are created. In the\npaper at hand, a cost analysis of cloud portfolios is presented. Therefore,\npricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization\ndataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can\nonly be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines\nare purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of\nmigrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is\npresented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines\nof cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year. The paper further\nshows that most of the resources of virtual machines are never utilized by\nconsumers, which represents a significant future potential for cost\noptimization. For the validation of the results, a second dataset of the\nBitbrains datacenter was used, which contains utility data of virtual machines\nfrom a different domain of application."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Extending beyond\npunctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,\nsubjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static\nsummaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to\nchanges in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we\ninvestigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by\nLLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping\nexperiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal\nquantification (for all) are processed very differently.

Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in\npoor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized\nas one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple\nlocal updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift\narises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied\nwell. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients\nat each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that\ndeviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift\nsince the optimization objective shifts with every round.\n  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client\ndrift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on\ncross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these\nissues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated\nmethod, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to\nmitigate their overall impact.

Post-training quantization\n(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language\nModels (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced\ngeneralization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a\n16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and\noverall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are\nsuccessful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in\nscenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs\nof epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are\ninsufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit\nbelief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially\ngrounded collaboration in LLM-based agents."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

This obstacle arises from the way models\ninherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in\nspurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,\ncurrent methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required\nto isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end\nEnergy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\\textbf{ERIS}) framework\nto enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that\neffective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also\nsemantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key\nmechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an\nenergy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance\nfor the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a\nweight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between\ndomain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their\ninterference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances\nrobustness by injecting structured perturbations.

Our empirical analysis shows\nthat the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be\nenergy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy\nwith lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in\ninference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,\nmodel size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong\ncorrelation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating\nthat execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings\nwhere direct measurement is not feasible.

To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers.

However, estimating the MFD for a given network\nrequires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in\npractice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a\nsubcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to\nnew tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed\nmodel is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and\nexploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of\ndetectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is\napplied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically\ndesigned to estimate the MFD.

While subword\nmethods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,\nthey often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages\nbecause they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a\nhybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis\nwith statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological\nnormalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances\nmorpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers\nto phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms\n(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic\nintegrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an\nUPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is\nintegrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological\ncoherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish\nToken Percentage (90.29\\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\\%). Comparisons with\ntokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and\ncoherent tokens.

Existing methods typically rely on\nprompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text\nencoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,\nprior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales\nthat fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In\nthis work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition\nbenchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple\nground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more\ncomprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of\nprevious approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)\nframework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image\nembeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,\nour framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict\naccurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on\nthe multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong\nzero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy\nand rationale quality.

However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's\nbounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the\nlearning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's\nand predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship\nat the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger\nobjects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,\nwe present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:\n(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse\nreal-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class\nrelational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.\nWe highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing\nIoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the\nstandard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%\nin mAP$^{\\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without\nany additional hyperparameter tuning.

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational\nprinciple of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need\nto match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite\nthe importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive\nstudies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension\ndifficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of\nChinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading\ncomprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade\nteachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers\nnationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot\nlearning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of\nrandom guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance\nimproves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy\nof their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging\nabilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in\ntheir current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the\nbest-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting\ndifficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,\nsignificant variations in model performance across different genres underscore\nthe complexity of task.

This work introduces\nFedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors\nthe spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by\nassigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with\nperiodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance\nclimate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble\n(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under\ndifferent FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent\nbaselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and\nmid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to\ntransfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited\nfor geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a\nscalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for\nphysically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a\nchanging climate.

In contrast to\ntheir vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant\ncomputational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and\nprocessing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce\nthese demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the\nessential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's\npredictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation\napproaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level\noptimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and\noriginal nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this\nsense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn\nlinear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent\nand less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph\ncondensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a\nnovel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition\n(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an\ninformative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.\nExtensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD\neffectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up\nto a 4.0\\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive\nperformance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.

Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)\nrepresentation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.\nFinally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global\ndistribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further\npredict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct\nexperiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned\non multiple emotional audios.

Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven\nmethods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the\ngrueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a\nrobust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where\nlocalization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the\nneural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train\nthe neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to\nobtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon\nlocation estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for\npositioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a\nblessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using\nEuclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on\nlabeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our\ncollected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning\naccuracy.

Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is\nreliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model\nis presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,\nperformance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm\n(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although\nthis phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been\nsystematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to\nconfirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under\nIPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a\nphenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent\nability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which\nremains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we\npropose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main\nmodules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship\ndiscrimination and cognitive editing.

We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with\nrespect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on\nmisspecification and quantization errors.

Existing theoretical studies on the\nlearning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning\nalgorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude\nconnection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum\ndegree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk\n(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the\ngeneralization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional\nsettings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine\nhow graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several\nkey contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure\nand learning in GNNs.

With this established framework, we further\nexplore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the\nperformance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we\nextend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing\nnon-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights\ninto the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning\nalgorithms.

The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by\ntheir computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing\nstrategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods\nhave been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation\nbetween skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot\nprocess large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy\npoints, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on\nregistration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread\napplicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based\ncoarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated\ncorrespondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud\ntransformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network\nand a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second\nstages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point\nmovement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood\nprecision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric\nstructures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous\nglobal features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated\nrecurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose\nan auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical\norgans.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered\ndatasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization\nresults.

However, their\ntheoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains\nunderexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a\ncontrolled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align\nwith our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical\nunderstanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,\nand provides practical guidance for designing effective models."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

However, the exact\ncomputation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,\nseverely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The\nchallenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as\nin Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather\nthan point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling\nhigher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class\nof GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and\ninteractions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global\nexplanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise\nexplanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components\nand compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,\ncapturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global\nexplanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and\ncompute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the\nmodel's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)\nM\\\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive\nalgorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean\nand variance of Shapley values.

Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to\nunseen graph sizes.

Statistical and data-driven\napproaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their\nadaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive\nannotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.\nRecent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide\npromising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This\npaper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel\nframework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of\nfoundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD\naddresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data\nsparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity.

However, the increasing\nresolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um\nor finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.\nConventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient\nand unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low\nexpression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and\nevaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel\nhistology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution\nST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net\nemploys a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene\nexpression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel\nrepresentations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a\nsuper-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output\nchannels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also\nbetter preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To\nenhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce\nSSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for\nhigh-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent\nframework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled\nsolution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions\nlay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and\nresolution-aware.

LLM inference is an online and multi-task\nservice process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM\nprocesses input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,\nit is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power\nconsumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms\nthat leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the\nprediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each\nrequest.\n  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$, which\nschedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to\nprevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as\nprediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to\npotential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted\nlower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during\ninferencing. We prove that $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ achieves a log-scale\ncompetitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,\nhighlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.\nMoreover, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the\nprediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output\nlength are typically more challenging to predict accurately."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter\narray (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\\'e patterns that severely\ndegrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\\'eing models have\nbeen proposed to remove such moir\\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer\nfrom several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a\nframe, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)\nchannel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across\nframes. We address these issues with the Moir\\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive\nTransformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled\nMoir\\'e Adaptive Demoir\\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\\'eing\n(STAD). DMAD separates moir\\'e and content via a Moir\\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)\nand a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\\'e-adaptive features\nusing a Moir\\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD\nintroduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture\nlarge-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel\ndependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs\nimplicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module.

To address this\nproblem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within\na diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework.

We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data\naugmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,\nwhich improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and\nmonocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,\nachieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving\nstandalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods\nsince we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional\nsupervision.

This strategy allows the model to create more\ndiverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge\nembedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text.

Existing approaches suffer from two key\nlimitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and\ndata-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while\nlarge language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural\nlanguage interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical\nreasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our\napproach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex\ndependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph\nattention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured\nembeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via\nreinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input\ncharacteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework\noperates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,\ndynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and\nprojecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to\ngenerate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three\ntasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised\nand zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers\ncompetitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing\nstrong generalization and cross-task adaptability.

To tackle this problem, we\npropose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion\nLanguage Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:\nmolecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a\npre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure\nControl Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two\ndistinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM\nto inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively\nanchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further\nintroducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated\nmolecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and\nadaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement\nin molecular generation for drug discovery applications."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Furthermore,\nwe integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating\nblurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization\nwith limited training data.

To\naddress this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning\nframework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and\ninjected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and\nsequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,\nDualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the\naggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state\nrecognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of\nDualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that\ninclude both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent\nperformance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional\nmethods."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

However, license plate areas in dash cam\nimages often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make\naccurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on\npretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently\nintroducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose\na novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,\nMF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and\naggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To\nachieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow\nestimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and\ncorrect erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal\nconsistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances\nboth image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential\ncontent of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR\n(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of\nlow-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth\nimages, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,\nMF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,\nand LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an\naccuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and\nthe multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models.

Despite its operational and environmental\nbenefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing\nCDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as\ntrajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where\nexplainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study\naddresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)\nframework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive\ndataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related\nfeatures, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent\nSurveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then\napplied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by\nimportance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,\nwere then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the\nextraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification\naccuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for\noperational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the\narrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in\ndirectional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO\nperformance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway\nfor operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to\nenable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying\noperational conditions."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide\na foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment.

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from\nreference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with\nhighly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight\nas the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate\nimages, delivering more customized illumination control than existing\ntechniques and charting new directions for research in illumination\nharmonization and editing."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

However, conventional\nfine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution\ndrift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in\ncompromised texture realism and temporal coherence.

To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the\ncontrol architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector\nthat filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their\npropagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector\nemploying a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines\nMLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control\nfeature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control\nsignal modulation.

WeedSense leverages a dual-path encoder\nincorporating Universal Inverted Bottleneck blocks and a Multi-Task Bifurcated\nDecoder with transformer-based feature fusion to generate multi-scale features\nand enable simultaneous prediction across multiple tasks. WeedSense outperforms\nother state-of-the-art models on our comprehensive evaluation. On our\nmulti-task dataset, WeedSense achieves mIoU of 89.78% for segmentation, 1.67cm\nMAE for height estimation, and 99.99% accuracy for growth stage classification\nwhile maintaining real-time inference at 160 FPS. Our multitask approach\nachieves 3$\\times$ faster inference than sequential single-task execution and\nuses 32.4% fewer parameters.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale\nvision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data\npoints and outperforms strong baselines."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs\ncan exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.\nMoreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and\nmessage-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias\nby filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge\ndropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may\nunintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised\nbalance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we\npresent a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias\nmitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using\ncounterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node\nrepresentations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial\ndiscriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN\nclassifiers.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through\nreal-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated\nscenarios are both plausible and critical.

However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal\ndynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and\nenvironmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors.

Specifically, a Two-Phase\nUncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke\ndetection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via\noptical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is\nperformed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set\nfractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities.

State-of-the-art deblurring methods for\nextreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches\nlike Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose\nestimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods\nrelying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to\nunreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly\nfrom extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep\nlearning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and\ngenerates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which\nenables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a\nprobability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and\n(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for\nstable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,\ninaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,\nwe propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:\n(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that\nare then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and\noverall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from\nseverely blurred inputs."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

While such scaling has been well studied for\nlanguage modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in\nthis regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,\nvalue-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute\nallocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed\ncompute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes\nto maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we\ncall TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for\nsmall models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use\nof large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this\nphenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize\ncompute usage.

These methods require training on vast amounts of data\nusually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most\ninstitutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other\nhand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific\ndata, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is\ntransferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly\nvaluable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the\ndevelopment of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new\nmodel-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and\npreservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a\nshared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by\ntheir distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation\nstrategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating\nknowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.\nBy unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit\nteachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.\nOur model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently\nsupports multiple downstream tasks.

It\nbecomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate\nlimitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are\ncharacterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,\nthat can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB\ncameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the\nchallenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we\npropose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object\npose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the\ncore advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an\nevent-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement\nan object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF\nvelocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the\nmethod can track pose when objects move at high-speed.

Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene\noptimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of\nconsistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent\nedits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing\npretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive\nresearch in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing\ndataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this\ndataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent\nedited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel\ncomponents: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven\nedits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video\nsynthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform\nhigh-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse\ninputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier\nto generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nediting, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks.

However, existing\nmethods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval\nperformance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the\nfine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained\nfeatures for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve\nperformance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine\nobjectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,\nincluding contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for\ntraining is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which\nis designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in\ncaptions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the\noriginal captions, referred to as \"Repetition\", can enhance retrieval\nperformance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this\ninsight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates\na voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better\nretrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental\nresults on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nprevious approaches.

First, we assessed CT and MRI\nmeasurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.\nSecond, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns\nstratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model\npancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2\ndiabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with\ntype 2 diabetes.\n  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13\nmorphological features were significantly different between patients with type\n2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons\ncorrections).

However, prior methods typically decouple geometry\nand motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then\nestimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates\nthe reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects\nwith complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation\nthat jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This\nformulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports\narticulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior\napproaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.\nTo systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a\nnew benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each\nwith diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry\nreconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We\nfurther demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic\nsimulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of\nunified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}
