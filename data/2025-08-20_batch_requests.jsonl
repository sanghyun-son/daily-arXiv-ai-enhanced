However, current agentic ecosystems remain\nfragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for\nAgentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an\nopen architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still\nfaces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value\nmeasurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from\ninherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,\nheterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic\nWeb (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not\nonly offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has\nthe potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data\nownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and\nthe monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the\nBetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,\noutlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration\nand autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing\nproducts and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.\nUltimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay\nthe foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized\ndigital ecosystem.

A\nmulti-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)\nstructured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent\nstages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from\nthe first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient\nassignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may\nbe highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the\nagents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a\nmulti-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which\nguarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is\nthe maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting\nan instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness\n($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair\nalgorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for\nC-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the\nDC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the\nconvergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.\nWe derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency\non the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy.

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends\ntraditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive\nmechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis\nconfirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple\ntask types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory\nsuperiority in LLM systems.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents.

When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction\nset of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high\nprobability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality.

While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints.

Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient.

Recent studies have explored frequency\ndomain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.\nHowever, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:\n(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns\nin a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency\nfiltering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their\ndistinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg\n(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering\nmodule (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive\nbehavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively\nemphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other\nranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to\ngenerate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique\ncharacteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse\nuser behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum.

Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces.

However,\ngenerative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to\nhallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.\nFurthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less\neffective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on\ndomain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a\nreasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through\ntraining reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,\nour DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its\nown OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to\nobtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks\nabout the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since\narchitectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes\nthem less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate\nhallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and\neasy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We\nevaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that\nour DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning\ncounterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our\nmethod."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce\nsearch framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and\ntheir combinations.

It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),\ncohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and\nadaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated\nmultimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently\noutperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning\nor zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial\nimprovements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image\nretrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to\nlarger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B).

Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-\nor few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,\nbut this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific\nadaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,\nresulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue\ncontext for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative\nrelationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE\ncustomizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation\nsystems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,\nproducing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those\nrecommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and\nunbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that\nincorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information\nsignificantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average\nof 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets.

In this work, we identify a significant gap\nbetween LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they\noften answer \"Yes\" to queries like \"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\",\nthey will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or\neven directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To\nsystematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)\ntheir knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify\ncorresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to\navoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in\nspecialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling\nmodel capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety\nconcerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk\nverifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an\nabstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract\ndescriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks.

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models.

Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution\nfollows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.\nConsequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to\nconcentrate on the most essential point of the UI element.

Then, we\ndiscuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nfrom three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.\nFinally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions.

In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier\ncalled HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and\nadaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our\nclassifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly\nmodeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.\nThe other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that\ndynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific\nconvergence rates. It effectively resolves the \"one-strong-many-weak\"\noptimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance\nrobustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting\ncontrolled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we\nformalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to\nevaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization.

To address\nthis issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image\nefficiently.

DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for\nneurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and\ncomputational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and\nemulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key\ncomponents. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic\nmodels and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural\nextension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of\nlogic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the\narchitecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated\nat the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as\ncomputational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a\nneurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate\nlevel of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog\nis implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing\nalgebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain\ndifferent neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying\nalgebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog\nneurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison\nbetween 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in\nthe architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based\nimplementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework\nfor PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address\nthis challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms\ninfinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent\nspace, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear\ninteractions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the\nLocal-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in\nturbulence.

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,\nwe employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence\nscores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial\nvalidation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on\nthree public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC\noutperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior\ndiagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC\nachieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the\nbest-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent\ncomplementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry.

The current MER methods in deep learning\nmainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image\nsequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'\nfine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This\npaper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical\nattention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D\nand 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN\nAMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network\nResnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different\ndata loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly\ntrains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts\nthe parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves\nthe effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.\nExtensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly\nimproves task performance.

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only\napproach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring\ndedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision\nTransformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal\nencoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network\nintegrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future\ngaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on\na comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median\nangular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based\nbaselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach\nmaintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene\ntypes, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware\nrequirements.

Although medical AI has been rapidly\nadvancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains\nlimited, preventing widespread clinical adoption.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical\ndistribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and\nmultimodal behavior representation in continuous control."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights\ninto SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our\nfinding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate\nperturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep\nevaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse\n(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are\ninefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can\nbe pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the\nCIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the\nrequired attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in\nwhite-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable\nattack success rate."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure", "description": "Analyze paper abstract and extract key information", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"tldr": {"type": "string", "description": "generate a too long; didn't read summary"}, "motivation": {"type": "string", "description": "describe the motivation in this paper"}, "method": {"type": "string", "description": "method of this paper"}, "result": {"type": "string", "description": "result of this paper"}, "conclusion": {"type": "string", "description": "conclusion of this paper"}, "relevance": {"type": "string", "description": "relevance level between the abstract and user interests: Must, High, Medium, Low, or Irrelevant"}}, "required": ["tldr", "motivation", "method", "result", "conclusion", "relevance"]}}}], "tool_choice": {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Structure"}}}}

Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100\nkm/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times\nthe 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning\nand braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend\nautonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,\nwhich need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most\nexisting perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye\nView (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and\ncompute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top\nof a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of\nmulti-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised\npre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled\ncamera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and\nachieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of\n30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,\nreaching distances up to 250 meters.

However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving\nhigh-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,\nresulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To\naddress this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework\nfor 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,\nnoise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of\nthese teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight\nstudent model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a\nstructural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric\ndistributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed\nDistilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,\nachieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage\nefficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to\nhandle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in\ntemporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained\nsetting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both\nfine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more\ndetailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed\ndataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense\nmodification text that is around seven times more than its existing\ncounterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual\ninformation through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,\nenabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.\nThe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing\nmethods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\\% Recall@1 in visual+text\nsetting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\\%, highlighting its\nefficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense\nmodification texts.
