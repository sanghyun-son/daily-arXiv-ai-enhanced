However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the\nresulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies\ndemonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings.

To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer\nType-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates\nconsumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type\ntheory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and\nexpert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.\nsatisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction\nhistories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user\ntypes in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate\nuser types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that\ndynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query\ncomplexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like\nstrategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,\nand Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces\ninteraction turns compared to strong baselines.

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends\ntraditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive\nmechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts.

Although various algorithmic\napproaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large\nlanguage models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,\nsystematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics\npredominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting\nis computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific\nstrategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only\npredictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal\nstability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the\nclosed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders\nreproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we\npropose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation\nframework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall\nquality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive\npower, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and\ndiversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms\ndemonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to\ncomprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and\nhigher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior\nalphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches.

To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we\npropose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals\nthat capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different\nsettings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and\nco-citations.

Moreover, we demonstrate that through\nsimple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase\ngeneration tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established\nCopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times\nfaster.", "AI": {"tldr": "CASPER\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uacfc \ud575\uc2ec\uc5b4(keyphrase)\ub97c \ud45c\ud604 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uacfc\ud559 \ub17c\ubb38 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uac1c\ub150\uc801\u00b7\uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uce6d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\ubaa9, \uc778\uc6a9 \ubb38\ub9e5, \uc800\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec\uc5b4, \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc778\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \ud559\uc220\uc801 \ucc38\uc870 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacfc\ud559 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c\u00b7\ubc00\uc9d1 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\ub85c \ud575\uc2ec\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \ub354 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec\uc5b4\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc220 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \ud3ed\ubc1c\uc801 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \ub530\ub77c\uc7a1\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc84c\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac1c\ub150\uc801\u00b7\uc138\ubd80\uc801 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2e8\uc704\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud1a0\ud070\uacfc \ud0a4\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ud76c\uc18c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 CASPER \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548. \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\ubaa9, \uc778\uc6a9 \ubb38\ub9e5, \uc800\uc790 \ud575\uc2ec\uc5b4, \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc778\uc6a9 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac-\ubb38\uc11c \uc30d\uc744 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ud0b4. \ub610\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\ub85c \ud0a4\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9.", "result": "8\uac1c\uc758 \uacfc\ud559 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ubc0f \ubc00\uc9d1 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00. \ud0a4\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 CopyRNN \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ub354 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0a4\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uac70\uc758 4\ubc30 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131.", "conclusion": "\ud1a0\ud070+\ud0a4\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988 \uae30\ubc18 \ud76c\uc18c \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ud559\uc220\uc801 \ucc38\uc870 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc220 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ud0a4\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems\n(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic\nsystems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,\nagentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge\nfor conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between\nhandling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the\nfirst conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent\nto integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a\nuser query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.\nFor straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool\nfor rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing\nmodule to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to\nthe intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks\nusing personalized recommendation tools.

While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOLO11-CR\uc740 \uc6b4\uc804\uc790 \uc878\uc74c \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1d\uccb4\uac80\ucd9c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, CAFM(Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module)\uacfc RCM(Rectangular Calibration Module)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \uac1d\uccb4\u00b7\uac00\ub824\uc9c4 \uac1d\uccb4\u00b7\ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ud2b9\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.

To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous\nknowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase\noptimization strategy.

(ii) It then learns\nan item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling\nsemantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is\noptimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and\ncomputational efficiency.

However, in\nreal-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed\nthrough modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in\nintricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths.\nSuch complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as\nextended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning\neffectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore,\ndeveloping an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of\nhandling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue.

To effectively\nmodel intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism\nwithin the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this\nmechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the\nmodel's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.\nThe deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused\nfeatures, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social\nmedia data into informative and noninformative categories across various\nnatural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and\n5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal\ndata. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into\nthe sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to\nreal time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize\nthe accuracy of emergency interventions.

However, current agentic ecosystems remain\nfragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for\nAgentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an\nopen architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still\nfaces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value\nmeasurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from\ninherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,\nheterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic\nWeb (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not\nonly offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has\nthe potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data\nownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and\nthe monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the\nBetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,\noutlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration\nand autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing\nproducts and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.\nUltimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay\nthe foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized\ndigital ecosystem.

However, it is very challenging\nto accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior\nsequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet\nsuch requirements, existing methods \"inadvertently\" destroy two basic\nrequirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire\nsequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information\nfrom the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned\ninterests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems\nis significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest\ninformation obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient\ntwo-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering\nbased twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction\nstage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two\nbasic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service\nefficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE\nclusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To\nreduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric\nlearning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative\npairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space.

One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is\nidiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be\nunderstood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.\nIn this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect\nidiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We\nevaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1\ndistillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four\nidiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller\nand more varied than expected.

These\napproaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less\nprominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.\nTo solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a\nguarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The\ncalibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's\nprofile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the\nrecommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the\ntotal number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a\ndifferent evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate\nin a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models\nthat help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the\nusers' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate\nthat the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the\nstructures.

A\nmulti-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)\nstructured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent\nstages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from\nthe first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient\nassignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may\nbe highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the\nagents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a\nmulti-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which\nguarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is\nthe maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting\nan instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness\n($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair\nalgorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for\nC-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the\nDC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the\nconvergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.\nWe derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency\non the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy.

Recent studies have explored frequency\ndomain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.\nHowever, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:\n(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns\nin a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency\nfiltering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their\ndistinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg\n(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering\nmodule (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive\nbehavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively\nemphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other\nranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to\ngenerate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique\ncharacteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse\nuser behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum.

In\nresponse, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment\nmodels with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.\nSpecifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac\nknowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these\nplans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific\ncustomization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine\nplans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as\ncomplex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to\ninterpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When\nclinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final\nvalidation.

Datarus is trained not on isolated\nquestion-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning\nsteps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,\nall captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,\nnumerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline\ncombines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000\ntagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight\ntag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores\nboth single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a\nmemory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nfeaturing KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.\nA cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to\nsemantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague\nRL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning\ninterface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke\nPython tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On\ndemanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an \"AHA-moment\"\npattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges\navoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.\nAcross standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and\neven reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up\nto 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting\n18-49% fewer tokens per solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Datarus-R1-14B\ub294 Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\ub41c 14B \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc624\ud508 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, ReAct \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00 \ubc0f \ub300\ud559\uc6d0 \uc218\uc900 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc0ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30(144,000 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc), \ud0dc\uadf8 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, KV-cache \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c GRPO\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(\ucf54\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589)\uc640 \ub9ac\ud50c\ub809\uc158(CoT)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ucd94\ub860 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, AIME \ubc0f LiveCodeBench\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uacac\uc904\ub9cc\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc808\uc57d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud559\uc6d0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c(\uae08\uc735, \uc758\ud559, \uc218\uce58\ud574\uc11d \ub4f1)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uada4\uc801(\ucd94\ub860, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589, \uc624\ub958 \ucc98\ub9ac, \uc790\uae30\uc218\uc815, \uacb0\ub860)\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uace0\ub09c\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83.", "method": "(i) ReAct \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\uc81d\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30(144k \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc), (ii) \ud0dc\uadf8 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc885\ud569\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubaa8\ub378(HRM)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub4c0\uc5bc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, (iii) GRPO(\uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654)\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uad6c\ud604: KV-cache \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9, \uc21c\ucc28 \uc0dd\uc131, \ub808\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0e4\ub529. \ucf54\uc0ac\uc778 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uae4a\uc774\ub85c \ucd08\uc810 \uc774\ub3d9. \uc774\uc911 \ucd94\ub860 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(Agentic: ReAct+Python \uc2e4\ud589, Reflection: <think>/<answer> CoT).", "result": "AIME 2024/2025 \ubc0f LiveCodeBench\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uace0 QwQ-32B\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ucd5c\ub300 30% \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ub2f9 \ud1a0\ud070 18-49% \uc808\uac10. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 'AHA-moment' \ud328\ud134(\uac00\uc124 \uc81c\uc2dc-\uc218\uc815-\uc218\ub834)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\u00b7\ud1a0\ud070 \ud33d\ucc3d\uc744 \ud53c\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud2b8\ub798\uc81d\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5, \uc774\uc911 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4, GRPO \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc774\uc911 \ucd94\ub860 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc774 \ub300\ud559\uc6d0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "relevance": "Error"}}

However, MES classification remains challenging due to\nlabel noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the\nscore, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum\nlearning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal\nstructure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston\nBowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation\nconfidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum\nis further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.\nExperiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and\nTransformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong\nsupervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches\n82.5\\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These\nresults highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for\nimproving ordinal classification under label uncertainty.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how\ndifferent memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized\ninformation. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with\na unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and\nimplicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments.

The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the\npowerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these\nmethods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although\ncontrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to\naddress the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main\nlimitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective\nrepresentations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable\ninformation in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the\nhomograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in\nincomplete mining of user-item interplay.\n  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for\n\\textbf{R}\\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\\textbf{A}l cont\\textbf{R}astive learning\nand ho\\textbf{M}ography relations (\\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement\nmulti-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal\nconstraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and\nretain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine\nhomogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user\ninterest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user\nco-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning.

This raises concerns either in\ncomputability, interpretability, and sustainability.

Performance assessment -- with\ncomparative benchmarks -- require open datasets shared under FAIR principles\n(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), with MRE (Minimal Reproducible\nExample) ancillary data for reuse. We share LUNDIsim, an exemplary faulted\ngeological mesh. It is inspired by SPE10 comparative Challenge.

Unlike the prior related\nworks, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked\nregression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback\nlinearize the true governing equations of a physical model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sparse regression\uacfc Lie \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac70\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc120\ud615\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131 \ub4f1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4(\ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uad00\ucc30, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\uc815 \ub4f1)\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\uc120 \ud76c\uc18c \ud68c\uadc0(sparse regression)\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ub2e4\uc74c \ucd9c\ub825\ud568\uc218 \uc0ac\uc804(dictionary)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 Lie \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud574 \uc0c1\ub300 \ucc28\uc218(relative degree) \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac15 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c stacked(\uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c) \ud68c\uadc0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc0c1\ub300 \ucc28\uc218 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc810\uc774 \uc0c8\ub86d\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ub3d9\uc791(\uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd)\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc120\ud615\ud654\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5(\uc2e4\ud5d8/\uc218\uce58 \uc608\uc81c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131)\uc774 \uc554\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud76c\uc18c \ud68c\uadc0\uc640 Lie \ub3c4\ud568\uc218 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300 \ucc28\uc218 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc9c0\ubc30\ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uacfc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc120\ud615\ud654\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9ac\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac stacked regression\uacfc \uc0c1\ub300 \ucc28\uc218 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc5ec\uc774\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce\nsearch framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and\ntheir combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a\nflexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive\nfusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations\nwhile handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training\nstrategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),\ncohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and\nadaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated\nmultimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently\noutperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning\nor zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial\nimprovements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image\nretrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to\nlarger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy\nUniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search\nscenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\\%) and\nRevenue (+8.33\\%).

In\nresponse, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment\nmodels with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.\nSpecifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac\nknowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these\nplans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific\ncustomization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine\nplans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as\ncomplex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to\ninterpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When\nclinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final\nvalidation.

However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage.

However,\nexisting systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:\ndecisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not\nnecessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our\nwork aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching\n(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative\napproach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task\nlike existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most\nconfident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,\ncomatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the\nhuman decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.\nThe results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch\noutperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic\nmatching on their own.

Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-\nor few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,\nbut this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific\nadaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,\nresulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue\ncontext for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative\nrelationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE\ncustomizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation\nsystems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,\nproducing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those\nrecommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and\nunbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that\nincorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information\nsignificantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average\nof 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in\nthe CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that\nexternal recommenders provide based on contextual insights.

When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction\nset of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high\nprobability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality.

However, their scalability is limited by\nsubstantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.\nFurthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs\n- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant\ncomputational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE\ntraining system designed to deliver scalable training performance for\nnext-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel\ntechniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform\nkernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with\nsequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,\npowered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to\n545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable\nmodel with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining\nhigh training throughput.

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This\napproach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex\nconstraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to\nconstrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained\ngeneration, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve\nsignificant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target\ndistributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show\nhow our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,\nusing queries to a hard-label black-box classifier.

Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six\nstandard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared\nto LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This\nwork shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural\nnetworks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to\neach other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for\nbuilding autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical\nreal-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOOP\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud50c\ub798\ub108\uac00 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\u00b7\uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4. 13\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc801 \ubaa8\ub4c8(\uc608: GNN, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac80\uc99d, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\ud574, \uc778\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 PDDL\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ub85d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4.

While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which\nrequires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically\napply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has\nalready been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes.

However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while\nneglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,\nmodality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal\ngeneralisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a\nmodality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse\nmodalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared\nprompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically\nrelated instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared\nprompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of\nadditional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual\nbenchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance\nwhile preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space.

To effectively\nmodel intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism\nwithin the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this\nmechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the\nmodel's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.\nThe deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused\nfeatures, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social\nmedia data into informative and noninformative categories across various\nnatural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and\n5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal\ndata. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into\nthe sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to\nreal time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize\nthe accuracy of emergency interventions.

This bias\nallows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only\nthe vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question\n(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in\nvisual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the\nvisual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut\nfor VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To\nfix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates\nhard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how\ndifferent memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized\ninformation. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with\na unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and\nimplicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments.

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and\ngeneralization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of\nreal-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities.

To be published in SC 2025", "summary": "Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as\nDeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert\nsegmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by\nsubstantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.\nFurthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs\n- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant\ncomputational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE\ntraining system designed to deliver scalable training performance for\nnext-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel\ntechniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform\nkernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with\nsequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,\npowered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to\n545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable\nmodel with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining\nhigh training throughput.

The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing\ndomain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge\nacross disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of\nmore general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a\ndomain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific\nworkflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript\npreparation.

To\ntackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a\ncontinuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for\nSchema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,\nmulti-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.\nOur table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and\nrecommendations by leveraging an initial schema.

This necessitates a deep exploration of the\ndecoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate\nindependently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with\ndifferent modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To\naddress this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement\nframework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables\nindividual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional\nexpression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four\nlightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent\nspaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space\nis characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define\nspecific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce\northogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate\nmotion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.\nThe learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared\nvisual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each\nspace, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head\nsynthesis.

We\nfind that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models\nachieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,\nPhysics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs\nunderperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3\n(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially\nshort of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English\ninstructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,\ndecreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop\ncollaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.\nCode and data are available at: https://vi-exam.github.io.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViExam\uc774\ub77c\ub294 2,548\ubb38\ud56d \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8\uc5b4 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec VLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc SOTA \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0 57.74%, \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0 27.70%\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0(66.54%)\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud568. \uc77c\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378(Thinking VLM o3)\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ub118\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd5c\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uc131\uacfc(99.60%)\uc5d0\ub294 \ud06c\uac8c \ubabb\ubbf8\uce68. \uc601\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc11e\ub294 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\ub9c1\uad6c\uc5bc \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, \ud734\uba3c-\uc778-\ub354-\ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \uc57d 5%p \uac1c\uc120 \uac00\ub2a5.", "motivation": "\uc601\uc5b4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c VLM\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4(\uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8\uc5b4)\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uad50\uc721 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568. \uad50\uc721\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uadf8\ub9bc\u00b7\uc218\uc2dd\u00b7\ud45c \ub4f1\uc774 \uc11e\uc778 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\ub9c1\uad6c\uc5bc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \ud30c\uc545\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "\ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8\uc5b4 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b ViExam(2,548\ubb38\ud56d, \uc218\ud559\u00b7\ubb3c\ub9ac\u00b7\ud654\ud559\u00b7\uc0dd\ubb3c\u00b7\uc9c0\ub9ac\u00b7\uc6b4\uc804\u00b7IQ \ub4f1 7\uac1c \ubd84\uc57c) \uad6c\uc131.

Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in\nspecialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling\nmodel capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety\nconcerns.

Published at ECAI 2025 in a version without the\n  Appendix", "summary": "Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is\nessential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve\nmapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,\nknown as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on\nprediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better\ncaptured by the word embeddings.

In this work, we propose a unified\nframework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at\nclients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy\n(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and\ncommunication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and\nintroduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating\nalgorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed\nsubmodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained\nlinear programming.

To address\nthis issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image\nefficiently.

The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)\nUnsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with\nadaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on\nspectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and\ntemporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both\nexact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating\nhemispheric congruence and electrode proximity.

Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)\nwere highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those\nwith successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas\nfailure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460).

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the\nintrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also\nenhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen\nclinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL\nfor real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks.

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that\nfine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with\nchain-of-thought rationales.

While various deep generative models have\nbeen developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,\nMolecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have\nemerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.\nHowever, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language\nmodeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,\nmodel size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this\nwork, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing\nNovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5\nbillion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical\nanalyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured\nduring pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important\ndistinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training\nstability.

The observation initiates\nthe design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the\ndocument-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic\nspectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant\nfeatures for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test\ndatasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "MGT-Prism\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uc0dd\uc131\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8(MGT) \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc815\ub82c\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubbfc\uac10 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd88\ubcc0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc57d\uac04 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 MGT \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130(\ub3c4\uba54\uc778)\ub85c \uc62e\uaca8\uac08 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec \ucc28\uc774(domain shift)\uac00 \uc8fc\ub41c \uc6d0\uc778\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud574 MGT\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \uc791\uc131 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8(HWT) \uac04 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc758 \ud06c\uae30 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc11c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubbfc\uac10 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc, \uacfc\uc81c \ud2b9\uc774\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc815\ub82c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "11\uac1c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, 3\uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc MGT-Prism\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8(SoTA) \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c 0.90% \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8, F1\uc5d0\uc11c 0.92% \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc6b0\uc218\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucc98\ub9ac(\uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 + \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc815\ub82c)\uac00 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 MGT \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2e4\uc804 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc600\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,\nneglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.\nRecent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:\n(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the\ndesired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and\nedges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges.

Aligning outputs to user-specific\npreferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning\nmodels for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally\nexpensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via\nValue-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment\nframework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the\nbase model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each\ncorresponding to a distinct objective.

Tracing evidence from which summaries are\nderived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this\nconcern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,\naspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with\nsentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.\nFirst, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,\nyielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation\nframework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and\nconsistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a\nsummarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for\ncomparison.

Accepted to IJCNN 2025", "summary": "Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many\nfields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)\nbring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning\nmainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image\nsequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'\nfine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This\npaper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical\nattention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D\nand 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN\nAMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network\nResnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different\ndata loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly\ntrains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts\nthe parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves\nthe effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.\nExtensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly\nimproves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet\nachieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1).

However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts.

However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these\nweighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for\nexplanation purposes.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": "", "relevance": "Error"}}

However, existing directed graph neural networks often\nstruggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural\npatterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering\nmechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel\nframework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware\ngraph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value\nembeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical\nspectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables\nlearnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral\nkernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection\nbases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to\nmodel multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through\nattention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during\nfeature propagation.

The performance of clustering can be\nimproved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view\nfeatures, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often\noverlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and\nConsistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective\nrepresentation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability\nand intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our\nframework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module\naligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between\nviews through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The\nbi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of\nfeature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the\ndifferent views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the\nconsistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the\nintra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA\nmethods.

Accepted to RANLP 2025", "summary": "Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical\nadoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment.

AdaptiveAE integrates an\nimage synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation\ninto our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure\nhistograms.

In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier\ncalled HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and\nadaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our\nclassifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly\nmodeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.\nThe other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that\ndynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific\nconvergence rates. It effectively resolves the \"one-strong-many-weak\"\noptimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance\nrobustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting\ncontrolled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries.

DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for\nneurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and\ncomputational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and\nemulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key\ncomponents. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic\nmodels and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural\nextension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of\nlogic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the\narchitecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated\nat the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as\ncomputational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a\nneurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate\nlevel of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog\nis implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing\nalgebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain\ndifferent neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying\nalgebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog\nneurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison\nbetween 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in\nthe architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based\nimplementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepLog\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801\u00b7\uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc8fc\uc11d\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud655\uc7a5 1\ucc28 \uc220\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \ud655\uc7a5 \ub300\uc218 \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac(\ubd88, \ud37c\uc9c0, \ud655\ub960\uc801)\ub97c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\uace0 GPU \uce5c\ud654\uc801 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub17c\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9(\uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 vs \uc190\uc2e4) \ubc0f \ub17c\ub9ac \uc885\ub958\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uba70, CPU vs GPU \uad6c\ud604 \ucc28\uc774\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uacfc \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ub17c\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\u00b7\uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "1) DeepLog \uc5b8\uc5b4: \uc8fc\uc11d\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 1\ucc28 \uc220\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac \uc720\ud615\uacfc \ub17c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654. 2) \ucef4\ud4e8\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub110 \ub808\ubca8: \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ub300\uc218 \ud68c\ub85c(\uc54cgebraic circuits)\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GPU \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uad6c\ud604. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub17c\ub9ac\u00b7\uad6c\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc120\uc5b8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd \uac00\ub2a5.", "result": "DeepLog\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud37c\uc9c0/\ud655\ub960 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc2dd(\uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub300 \uc190\uc2e4) \ube44\uad50, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uae30\uc874 CPU \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub300\ube44 GPU \uae30\ubc18 DeepLog\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DeepLog\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\u00b7\uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc94\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uba38\uc2e0\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc120\uc5b8\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 GPU \uce5c\ud654\uc801 \ub300\uc218 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640 \uad6c\ud604 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

In this process, benchmarks in the\nscientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning\ncapabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key\nchallenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in\nmultilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive\nmodality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge\npoints. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and\nchallenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs\ncover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and\nsupport five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We\nconducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source\nmodels, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for\nexisting MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini\nachieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly\nhigher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,\nusing MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed\nexisting models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in\nspecific domains.

Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN\nprimarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting\ngeometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our\napproach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such\nas VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their\npatch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes\nimage latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and\nspatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as\nposition, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the\ndensity of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in\nreconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token\nefficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves\nstrong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by\nincreasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a\nsignificant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art\nreconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially\noutperforming existing methods.

Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector\nMachines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and\nevaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random\nForest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to\n88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal\nclinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were\ngenerated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE\ncoordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the\nembedding space.

This limitation undermines their performance in terms of\ncoordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge\nwith CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural\ncausal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is\nthe Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from\nagent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states\ninfluence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action\nselection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting\nthem accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when\nneeded. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,\nCausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without\nrequiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the\nOvercooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four\nLLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.\nExperimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions\nand improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming\nstrong reinforcement learning baselines.

This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework\nfor PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address\nthis challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms\ninfinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent\nspace, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear\ninteractions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the\nLocal-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in\nturbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details\nand nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in\nexisting neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a\ndynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate\nlinear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical\nsystems.

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase.

Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the\neffectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and\nfactual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we\npropose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nrollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long\ncontext for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing\npreference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.\nSpecifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on\ntheir expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and\niteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and\nexploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context\nsegments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.\nFinally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and\napply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show\nthat LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference\ndata pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning\nbenchmarks.

Our key innovation is the design and\nimplementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and\nintuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established\nuncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo\nDropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we\ndemonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its\napplication on both synthetic and simulation datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub17c\ubb38 \ucd08\ub85d\uc740 \uc785\uc790 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc288\ud37c\uc5d8\ub9bd\uc2a4 \uad00(uncertainty tube)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uba70 Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, SWAG \uac19\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc785\uc790 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \uc774\ud574 \uc5c6\uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc288\ud37c\uc5d8\ub9bd\uc2a4(\uc288\ud37c\uc5d8\ub9bd\ud2f0\uceec) \uad00\uc744 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, SWAG \ub4f1 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uad00\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc288\ud37c\uc5d8\ub9bd\uc2a4 \uad00\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uad00\uc740 NN \uae30\ubc18 \uc785\uc790 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc2dc\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \ud574\uc11d\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly\ncomplex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes\nof data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,\nrendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,\nincluding their designers and developers; they are \"black boxes\" for all their\nstakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical\ncomplexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from\nview for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision\nsystems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness.

To address this issue, we have conducted a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG\nsystems.

From the theoretical\nanalysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from\nthe perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have\nexplored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.\nWe carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and\nAgentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to\nsolve seven different research questions.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,\nour best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the\nrespective instance generator.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\uc73c\ub85c PDDL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568. \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45\ud574 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud55c \ub4a4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ub514\ubc84\uae45\uc5d0 reflection \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucf54\ub4dc \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc548\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. 17\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5b4, 12\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc14\ub85c \ucf54\ub4dc\ud654\ud558\uba74 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc804\ub7b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uacac\u00b7\uc218\uc815\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "(1) \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc218\ud589, (2) \uc218\uc815\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0dd\uc131, (3) \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ubb3b\ub294 reflection \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd94\uac00, (4) \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc88b\uc740 \uac83 \uc120\ud0dd.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120(\uc808\ub300 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c). 17\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c 12\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uadf8 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 reflection \ubc0f \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcc0\ud615 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacc4\ud68d \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub192\uc784.", "relevance": "Error"}}

This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness.

Experimental evaluation on\na comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median\nangular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based\nbaselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach\nmaintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene\ntypes, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware\nrequirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements\nacross all evaluation metrics.

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "OHC(\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac74\uac15 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0) \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc758 \uac10\uc815\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uc9c0\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud574\uc11d \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ucf54\ub4dc\ubd81\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c in\u2011context prompting\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. 400\uac1c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c GPT \uacc4\uc5f4 LLM\ub4e4\uc740 BioBERT \ub4f1 \uc804\ubb38 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud569\uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud658\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac10\uc815\u00b7\uc784\uc0c1 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc554\uc2dc\uc801 \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac10\uc815\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 ML \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.

This\ndual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode\noptimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%\ncomputation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video\nCoding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics.

Because most rare variants on the genome\nhave not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease\nprediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction\nstrategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are\nproposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk\nprediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an\nextension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional\nprocedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the\nuse of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the\nGenetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction\nmodel built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on\ncommon variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two\napproaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.\nWe found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when\nthe number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,\nwhen there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of\n0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\uc790\ub294 \uacf5\ud1b5\ubcc0\uc774\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud76c\uadc0\ubcc0\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8\uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 'collapsing ROC(CROC)'\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.

However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nnamely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in\nunseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only\nemploying a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,\nDictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -\nto simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from\nnormal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region\nfeatures from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature\ncannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly.

To\naddress this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and\ninter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship\nbetween anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called\nAdaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or\nfar from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further\naway from the anchor point in the feature space.

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends\ntraditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive\nmechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis\nconfirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple\ntask types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory\nsuperiority in LLM systems.

However, its\nhigh computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains\nhave shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural\nnetworks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing\naccuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural\nframework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a\nsingle-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core\nchallenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable\neffective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs\ninitialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization\nacross diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric\nnormalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.\nLearnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in\npost-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and\nsimple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,\ngeneralizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic\nmanner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues\nto expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or\ninternal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,\ndistinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a\npromising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such\nas basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide\nexperimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics\ngrounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for\nstudying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable\nsetting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,\nespecially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics\nforecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can\nlearn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics\nforecasting in context improves with longer input contexts.

To circumvent the prohibitive cost of\nacquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain\nAdaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,\nsnow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate\nseveral novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,\nand hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse\nimages from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to\nsupport auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages\nboth simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact\nsupervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images\nhelp bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap.

To effectively\nmodel intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism\nwithin the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this\nmechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the\nmodel's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.\nThe deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused\nfeatures, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social\nmedia data into informative and noninformative categories across various\nnatural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and\n5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal\ndata. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into\nthe sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to\nreal time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize\nthe accuracy of emergency interventions.

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and\ngeneralization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of\nreal-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions.

In subgraph\nfederated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a\nlocal subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for\neach client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance\nvariation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local\nsubgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework\nbuilt on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors\nwith efficient personalized model generation.

To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer\nType-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates\nconsumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type\ntheory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and\nexpert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.\nsatisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction\nhistories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user\ntypes in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate\nuser types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that\ndynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query\ncomplexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like\nstrategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,\nand Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces\ninteraction turns compared to strong baselines.

However,\nexisting methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and\ngeometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between\nconflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual\ndecoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we\nintroduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for\nthe semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric\nbranch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,\ndecoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.\nOur dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are\nthen utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D\nfeatures. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module\nthat addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by\nanisotropically merging them into a unified representation.

In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability.

Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism\nand personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated\nVlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and\nhigh personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated\nmultimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized\nVlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a\ngiven theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ncollaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This\nframework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content\ncreation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity\nof the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism\nthat leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,\nthereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also\npropose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that\nprovides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation.

In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,\nwe are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and\nAIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with\na majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,\nthe best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25.

We address\nin-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging\nbenchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is\nconstructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI\nverified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the\ncollaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the\nrealistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a\nvision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective\nreasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a\nsupervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.\nBy further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is\nable to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate\nconclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,\nour best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the\nrespective instance generator.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\uc73c\ub85c PDDL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568. \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45\ud574 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud55c \ub4a4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ub514\ubc84\uae45\uc5d0 reflection \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucf54\ub4dc \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc548\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. 17\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5b4, 12\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc14\ub85c \ucf54\ub4dc\ud654\ud558\uba74 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc804\ub7b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uacac\u00b7\uc218\uc815\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "(1) \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc218\ud589, (2) \uc218\uc815\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0dd\uc131, (3) \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ubb3b\ub294 reflection \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd94\uac00, (4) \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc88b\uc740 \uac83 \uc120\ud0dd.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120(\uc808\ub300 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c). 17\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c 12\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uadf8 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 reflection \ubc0f \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcc0\ud615 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacc4\ud68d \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub192\uc784.", "relevance": "Error"}}

Although medical AI has been rapidly\nadvancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains\nlimited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally\nstems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,\nphysicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In\ncontrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target\nlesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical\nAI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to\ndiagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning\nPolicy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the\nphysicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.\nWe used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou\nUniversity Hospital.

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images.

None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models.

In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,\nenabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed\nnoises, have recently attracted significant attention\n\\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.\nHowever, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few\nexceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) \\citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed\nbandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the\nloss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework\nto the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed\nlinear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the\nbest-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose\na general data-dependent learning rate, termed \\textit{heavy-tailed noise aware\nstability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM).

When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction\nset of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high\nprobability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality.

However, it\nremains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty\nof collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving\nprivacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based\nframework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.\nUnlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative\ngenerative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,\nexclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of\ntemporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the\ngeneration process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates\nsuch as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating\nsynthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline\nleads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.\nAdditionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic\nindividuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity\nembeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and\nare useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.\nOverall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models\nfor high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "GaitCrafter\ub294 \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ubcf4\ud589 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c, \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubcf5\u00b7\uc18c\uc9c0\ud488\u00b7\uc2dc\uc810 \ub4f1 \uc870\uac74 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba74 \ubcf4\ud589\uc778\uc2dd \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubcf4\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4(\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub294) \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud574 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub77c\ubca8\ub41c \ubcf4\ud589 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf4\ud589 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0(\ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubb38\uc81c \ud3ec\ud568)\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(GaitCrafter)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548. \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc758\ubcf5\u00b7\ud734\ub300\ubb3c\u00b7\uce74\uba54\ub77c \uc2dc\uc810 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9(condition)\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4. \ub610\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\uac04\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "GaitCrafter\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud589\uc778\uc2dd \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba74 \uc778\uc2dd \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784. \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uace0\uc720 \ubcf4\ud589 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uce68\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\ud589 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\u00b7\uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\u00b7\ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\ud589\uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\uc57d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc784.", "relevance": "Error"}}

This paper presents OmniTry, a unified\nframework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,\ne.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical\napplication. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is\nchallenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the\ncorresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged\npipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,\nportraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free\nlocalization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically\ndraw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,\nthe model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency\nof object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows\nquick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a\ncomprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,\nwith both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that\nOmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and\nID-preservation compared with existing methods.

Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level\nrecognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization\npostprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs\nbut suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.\nGraph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network\nvertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast\ntopology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To\naddress these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines\ngraph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by\ndecoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex\nprediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural\ninnovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast\ninference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.\nComprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Existing methods are typically\ndesigned to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,\nPCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent\nboth aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction\nEnhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure\npreservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a\nsimple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings\nbetween the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally\nwell-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global\nstructure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,\nincluding five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population\ngenetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to\npreserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DREAMS\ub294 t-SNE\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874\uacfc PCA\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e8\uc21c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(\ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 \ubc0f \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc720\uc804\ud559 \ud3ec\ud568)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc815\uc131\uc801\u00b7\uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870(t-SNE, UMAP) \ub610\ub294 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870(MDS, PCA) \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub9cc \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub450 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uc798 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub450 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "DREAMS\ub294 t-SNE \ubaa9\uc801\ud568\uc218\uc5d0 PCA\uc640\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec, t-SNE(\uc9c0\uc5ed \ubcf4\uc874)\uc640 PCA(\uc804\uc5ed \ubcf4\uc874) \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc804\uc5ed\uc801 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "7\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(\ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 5\uac1c, \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc720\uc804\ud559 1\uac1c \ub4f1)\uc5d0\uc11c DREAMS\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc815\uc131\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\uc640 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 t-SNE\uc640 PCA\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of\nexploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training\ndata can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch\nsize and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over\nmultiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.\nLarge-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued\nexploration and reduced gradient noise.

Although Transformer-based models have made\nsignificant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series\nforecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of\nself-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested\nGroup Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of\nexplicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias\nfor effective time series modeling.

However,\ncurrent methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target\ntext or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics\ninto a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering\nfine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its\nbackground. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the\nQ-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,\nwithout LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and\ntransferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query\nAlignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more\ncontrolled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both\nstandard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual\nquestion-answering tasks in black-box environment.

The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)\nUnsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with\nadaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on\nspectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and\ntemporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both\nexact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating\nhemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that\nthe LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects\noutliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming\nexact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)\nwere highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those\nwith successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas\nfailure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460).

However, we observe that their performance degrades\nsignificantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues\nfrom different images become entangled in the model's output.

To address this issue, we\npropose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that\nmitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially\nmasks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the\nsingle clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain\nlogits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then\ncontrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the\nleakage and yields more accurate outputs.

To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems\n(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic\nsystems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,\nagentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge\nfor conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between\nhandling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the\nfirst conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent\nto integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a\nuser query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.\nFor straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool\nfor rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing\nmodule to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to\nthe intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks\nusing personalized recommendation tools.

This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the\ntrustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations\nof global properties such as bias.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our\nproposed methods on many synthetic and real data", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": "", "relevance": "Error"}}

To\nfix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates\nhard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it\nto the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these\nEOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)\nsettings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,\nproviding a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new\nannotations will be released soon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc77c\ubd80 \ub2e4\uc9c0\uc120\ub2e4\ud615 \uc2dc\uac01\uc9c8\ubb38\uc751\ub2f5(VQA) \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uac01+\uc635\uc158(V+O)\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f5\uc744 \ub9de\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Easy-Options Bias(EOB)\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc2dc\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c \uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 GroundAttack \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 VLM\ub4e4\uc740 V+O \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc5f0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, V+Q+O \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc838 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub2e4\uc9c0\uc120\ub2e4\ud615 VQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc635\uc158\ub4e4 \uac04 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc804-\uc635\uc158 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f5\uc744 \uace0\ub974\ub294 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\ub984\uae38(EOB)\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c8\uc758\uc751\ub2f5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacfc\ub300\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub354 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01-\uc635\uc158 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc815\ub2f5 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c \uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 GroundAttack \ud234\ud0b7\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c NExT-QA\uc640 MMStar \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud574 EOB-free \uc5b4\ub178\ud14c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "EOB-free \uc5b4\ub178\ud14c\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 VLM\ub4e4\uc740 (V+O) \uc785\ub825\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc6b0\uc5f0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, (V+Q+O)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud3ec\ud654\ub41c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c QA \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub354 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub09c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EOB\ub294 \ub2e4\uc9c0\uc120\ub2e4\ud615 VQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub97c \ud574\uce58\uba70, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

Existing methods have attempted to infer the\nintrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two\nmajor challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive\npriors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other\nmodels intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited\ninterpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,\nwe introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where\nLLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise\nconstitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially\nreduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a\nvision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual\nsimulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law\nand the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level\nevolution.

This process is typically approached in two ways:\none-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and\niterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for\npotentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has\nhistorically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather\nthan rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and\ncomprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,\nbenchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying\ndifferent pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has\nspecific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning\nratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on\nthese findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid\napproach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,\nproviding valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy\ntailored to their goals and constraints.

However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The\nunderlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that\nefficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.\nExtensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF\noutperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series\nforecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher\nforecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1(non-stationary) \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 EventTSF\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc624\ud1a0\ub9ac\uadf8\ub808\uc2dc\ube0c \ud655\uc0b0(autoregressive diffusion)\uacfc flow matching\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c timestep\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uba70, \uba40\ud2f0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\ub294 U\uc790\ud615 \ud655\uc0b0 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 denoiser\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 12\uac1c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 10.7% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728 1.13\ubc30 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\u00b7\uad50\ud1b5 \ub4f1 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc640 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uad00\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uac19\uc740 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801 \ub09c\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "EventTSF: (1) \ud788\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ub2e4\uc74c \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uad6c\uc870; (2) \uac01 \uc2a4\ud15d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4-\uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 autoregressive diffusion\uacfc flow matching\uc744 \uacb0\ud569; (3) \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c flow matching\uc758 timestep\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud574 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucc98\ub9ac; (4) \uba40\ud2f0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\u00b7\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud558\ub294 U\uc790\ud615(diffusion) \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 denoiser.", "result": "8\uac1c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c 12\uac1c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778 \ub300\ube44 \uc804\ubc18\uc801 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131 \uc785\uc99d. \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 10.7% \ud5a5\uc0c1, \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub294 \uc57d 1.13\ubc30 \ube68\ub77c\uc9d0. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8-\uc778\uc9c0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc6b0\uc704 \ud655\uc778.", "conclusion": "EventTSF\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\uad50\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\u00b7\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\u00b7\uba40\ud2f0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,\nrobustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and\nNon-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces\nmalicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a\nmodel retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data.

However, existing directed graph neural networks often\nstruggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural\npatterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering\nmechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel\nframework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware\ngraph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value\nembeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical\nspectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables\nlearnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral\nkernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection\nbases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to\nmodel multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through\nattention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during\nfeature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks\ndemonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and\ndirection-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new\nparadigm for learning representations on directed graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SVDformer\ub294 SVD\uc640 Transformer\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2f1\uade4\ub7ec \uac12 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 self-attention\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud574 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc131\ubd84\uc744 \uac15\uc870/\uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \uc2f1\uade4\ub7ec \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc29\ud5a5 \ud22c\uc601 \uae30\uc800\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 Transformer\ub85c \uc785/\ucd9c\ub825 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 GNN\ub4e4\uc740 \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131(\ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6c3\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4)\uacfc \uad6d\uc18c\uc801 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.", "method": "SVDformer\ub294 SVD\ub85c \uc5bb\uc740 \uc2f1\uade4\ub7ec \uac12/\ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2f1\uade4\ub7ec \uac12 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uba40\ud2f0\ud5e4\ub4dc self-attention\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc131\ubd84\uc744 \uc99d\uac15\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4(\ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub85c\uc6b0\ud328\uc2a4/\ud558\uc774\ud328\uc2a4 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1). \uc2f1\uade4\ub7ec \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc29\ud5a5 \ud22c\uc601 \uae30\uc800\ub85c, \uc2f1\uade4\ub7ec \uac12\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc778\uc790\ub77c\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0 Transformer\uc758 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc785/\ucd9c\ub825 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134 \uac04 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc131 \uc804\ud30c \uc2dc \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc874.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c SVDformer\uac00 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 GNN\ub4e4\uacfc \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "SVD\uc640 Transformer\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc740 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ubcf4\uc874\uacfc \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud574, \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "relevance": "Error"}}

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights\ninto SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our\nfinding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate\nperturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep\nevaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse\n(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are\ninefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can\nbe pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the\nCIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the\nrequired attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in\nwhite-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable\nattack success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": "", "relevance": "Error"}}

To address these challenges, this work\nrevisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey\ninvolving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in\nproperty ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows\nimproved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows\ndecreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further\nanalysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the\nconsistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the\nratings.

However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform\neffectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise\ndecreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of\nfirst-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global\nminimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with\nKronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high\ndamping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively\nwashes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,\nreducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,\nwe introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that\nrestores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch\nsizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster\nconvergence.

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and\ngeneralization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of\nreal-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities.

Among\nthem, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its\nconsistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow\nQ-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action\ngeneration during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary\nmodels, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL\nbenchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based\nbaselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time\ncompared to DQL.", "AI": {"tldr": "DQL\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\uc2a4\ud15d \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c One-Step Flow Q-Learning(OFQL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378/\uc99d\ub958/\ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5/\ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud568.", "motivation": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378(\ud2b9\ud788 diffusion model)\uc774 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ud45c\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 DQL\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uba40\ud2f0\uc2a4\ud15d \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9d0. \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ud15d(one-step) \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\ub098 \uae30\uc874 DQL\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uac10\ud568.", "method": "DQL\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Flow Matching(FM) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 FM\uc758 \uace1\uc120\ud615 \uc0dd\uc131 \uada4\uc801 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc7a5(average velocity field)\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\u00b7\uc99d\ub958\u00b7\ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "result": "D4RL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c OFQL\uc774 DQL \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 diffusion \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud588\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 DQL\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub2e8\ucd95\ub428.", "conclusion": "OFQL\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0\uc2a4\ud15d \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud574 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc6a9 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "relevance": "Error"}}

Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can\nprovide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating\nuncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have\noffered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their\nreliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication\noutages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that\nenables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution\nintegrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,\ncompressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.\nMoreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for\noptimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy\nconsumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer\ndata, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical\nmeasurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ\nper inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly\nless energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE\n0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to\nalign model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low\nenergy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,\nour work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more\nresilient combined sewer systems.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies.

To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous\nknowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase\noptimization strategy.

IL must balance\nadaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations\noften rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL\nperformance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object\nDetection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a\nfixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains\nand classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and\nsynthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera\nsensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture\nchallenges absent in existing evaluations.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping\nthem with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before\ndecision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)\nreward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the\namount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated\nvia Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)\nSIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to\nconstruct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)\nSIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a\nnovel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to\ninformative questions for targeted optimization.

Final version not published yet", "summary": "Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution\nperformance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently\nrelying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We\nintroduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept\nRepresentations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide\nmodels toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly\nimproves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective\neven in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy\nbinary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic\nspurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared\nto baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc\nconcept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic\nstrategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept\nsupervision.

They typically rely on\npre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics\nintegration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes\nor unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts\na 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,\nenabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We\nfirst establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction\nand probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically\nplausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics\nprediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nits simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the\ncomplex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the\ntraining, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,\nannotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates\nhigh-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute.

The\nframework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible\npolicy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the\nBudgeted-KMR algorithm.

State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly\nrely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a\nnovel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for\nFR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility\nscore for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated\nwith the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via\nglobal self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information\nacross all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two\nheads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn\ndiscriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)\nthe quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face\nsample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several\nFR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that\nViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance.

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a\nnon-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can\nbe modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped\ninto functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.\nEmerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these\ncommunities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively\ncapturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical\ndevelopment is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker\ndiscovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based\narchitecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to\ncapture neural signatures associated with ASD.

Since full retraining\nis costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this\npaper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning\nalgorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive\nstructure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning\nby estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant\ncomputational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this\nend, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to\napproximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of\nfirst-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,\nwe use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data\nremoval. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives\ndominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order\noptimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without\nconstructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning\nbaselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning\nquality.

Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100\nkm/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times\nthe 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning\nand braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend\nautonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,\nwhich need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most\nexisting perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye\nView (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and\ncompute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top\nof a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of\nmulti-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised\npre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled\ncamera-LiDAR data.

Although various algorithmic\napproaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large\nlanguage models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,\nsystematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics\npredominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting\nis computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific\nstrategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only\npredictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal\nstability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the\nclosed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders\nreproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we\npropose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation\nframework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall\nquality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive\npower, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and\ndiversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms\ndemonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to\ncomprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and\nhigher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior\nalphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All\nimplementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote\nreproducibility and community engagement.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": "", "relevance": "Error"}}

Despite its\ntheoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied\nwork, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of\npractical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically\ncomparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal\nscenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including\nsymbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a\ncommon evaluation framework.

We assess each method\nin terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to\nassumption violations.

ResPlan addresses key limitations of existing\ndatasets such as RPLAN (Wu et al., 2019) and MSD (van Engelenburg et al., 2024)\nby offering enhanced visual fidelity and greater structural diversity,\nreflecting realistic and non-idealized residential layouts. Designed as a\nversatile, general-purpose resource, ResPlan supports a wide range of\napplications including robotics, reinforcement learning, generative AI, virtual\nand augmented reality, simulations, and game development. Plans are provided in\nboth geometric and graph-based formats, enabling direct integration into\nsimulation engines and fast 3D conversion.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

However, MES classification remains challenging due to\nlabel noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the\nscore, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum\nlearning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal\nstructure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston\nBowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation\nconfidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum\nis further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.\nExperiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and\nTransformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong\nsupervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches\n82.5\\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost.

Existing DPCLs,\nhowever, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit\nco-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of\ndiscriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),\na DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.\nInspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract\nthe critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into\ndata-poisoning scenarios.

However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage.

In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability.

Toward real-time analytics,\nwe introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates\ncomputational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation\nconstellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices\nand allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic\nrouting algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication\noverhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth\nobservation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and\ninter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework\nfor 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,\nnoise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of\nthese teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight\nstudent model.

The performance of clustering can be\nimproved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view\nfeatures, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often\noverlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and\nConsistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective\nrepresentation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability\nand intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our\nframework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module\naligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between\nviews through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The\nbi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of\nfeature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the\ndifferent views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the\nconsistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the\nintra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA\nmethods.

However,\nexisting linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely\non sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich\ntextual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous\nknowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase\noptimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item\ncorrelation matrix from LLM-derived item representations.

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of\nexploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training\ndata can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch\nsize and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over\nmultiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.\nLarge-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued\nexploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which\naugments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K\nand Pass@1.

The most significant advantage of our\nclassifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly\nmodeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.\nThe other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that\ndynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific\nconvergence rates.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements.

At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model.

These\napproaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less\nprominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.\nTo solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a\nguarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The\ncalibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's\nprofile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the\nrecommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the\ntotal number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a\ndifferent evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate\nin a one-dimensional data space.

Currently, the\nmost widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which\nno longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging\nvulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work\nrevisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey\ninvolving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in\nproperty ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows\nimproved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows\ndecreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks.

Accepted to RANLP 2025", "summary": "Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical\nadoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our\nfindings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'.

In this process, benchmarks in the\nscientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning\ncapabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key\nchallenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in\nmultilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive\nmodality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge\npoints. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and\nchallenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs\ncover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and\nsupport five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We\nconducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source\nmodels, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for\nexisting MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini\nachieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly\nhigher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,\nusing MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed\nexisting models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in\nspecific domains.

We\nfind that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models\nachieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,\nPhysics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs\nunderperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3\n(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially\nshort of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English\ninstructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,\ndecreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop\ncollaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.\nCode and data are available at: https://vi-exam.github.io.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViExam\uc774\ub77c\ub294 2,548\ubb38\ud56d \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8\uc5b4 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec VLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc SOTA \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0 57.74%, \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0 27.70%\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0(66.54%)\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud568. \uc77c\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378(Thinking VLM o3)\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ub118\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd5c\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uc131\uacfc(99.60%)\uc5d0\ub294 \ud06c\uac8c \ubabb\ubbf8\uce68. \uc601\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc11e\ub294 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\ub9c1\uad6c\uc5bc \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, \ud734\uba3c-\uc778-\ub354-\ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \uc57d 5%p \uac1c\uc120 \uac00\ub2a5.", "motivation": "\uc601\uc5b4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c VLM\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4(\uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8\uc5b4)\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uad50\uc721 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568. \uad50\uc721\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uadf8\ub9bc\u00b7\uc218\uc2dd\u00b7\ud45c \ub4f1\uc774 \uc11e\uc778 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\ub9c1\uad6c\uc5bc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \ud30c\uc545\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "\ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8\uc5b4 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b ViExam(2,548\ubb38\ud56d, \uc218\ud559\u00b7\ubb3c\ub9ac\u00b7\ud654\ud559\u00b7\uc0dd\ubb3c\u00b7\uc9c0\ub9ac\u00b7\uc6b4\uc804\u00b7IQ \ub4f1 7\uac1c \ubd84\uc57c) \uad6c\uc131.

This process is typically approached in two ways:\none-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and\niterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for\npotentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has\nhistorically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather\nthan rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and\ncomprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,\nbenchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying\ndifferent pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has\nspecific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning\nratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on\nthese findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid\napproach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,\nproviding valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy\ntailored to their goals and constraints.

This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve\nmapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,\nknown as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on\nprediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better\ncaptured by the word embeddings.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce\nsearch framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and\ntheir combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a\nflexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive\nfusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations\nwhile handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training\nstrategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),\ncohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and\nadaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated\nmultimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently\noutperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning\nor zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial\nimprovements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image\nretrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to\nlarger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy\nUniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search\nscenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\\%) and\nRevenue (+8.33\\%).

This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization.

Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the\neffectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and\nfactual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we\npropose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nrollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long\ncontext for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing\npreference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.\nSpecifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on\ntheir expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and\niteratively update these scores based on reward feedback.

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a\nnon-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can\nbe modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped\ninto functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.\nEmerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these\ncommunities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively\ncapturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical\ndevelopment is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker\ndiscovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based\narchitecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to\ncapture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple\nspecialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively\nemphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to\nautism. This enables both improved classification performance and more\ninterpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers.

Since full retraining\nis costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this\npaper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning\nalgorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive\nstructure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning\nby estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant\ncomputational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this\nend, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to\napproximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of\nfirst-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,\nwe use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data\nremoval. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives\ndominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order\noptimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without\nconstructing the computational graphs.

This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that\nprefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance\ngains.
