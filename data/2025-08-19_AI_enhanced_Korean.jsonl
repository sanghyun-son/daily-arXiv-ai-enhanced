To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length\nto 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines,\nsignificantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SamKV\ub294 RAG(\uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131) \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911-\ubb38\ub9e5 KV \uce90\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uad50\ucc28 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c\ud654\uc640 \uad6d\uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 15%\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uacfc\uac70 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \ud76c\uc18c \uc5b4\ud150\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.

However, serving these models\nremains challenging in practice, particularly in resource-constrained edge\nenvironments, due to their large memory footprint and complex communication\ndemands. While centralized cloud inference is common, it incurs high\ninfrastructure costs, along with latency and privacy concerns. A few recent\nedge MoE works propose memory-efficient strategies but typically focus on\nsingle-device or homogeneous setups. This paper presents DanceMoE, an efficient\nMoE inference framework that enables activation-aware expert placement across\ncollaborative, heterogeneous, GPU-equipped edge servers. DanceMoE leverages the\ninherent sparsity of MoE models and workload locality to minimize cross-server\ncommunication and enable efficient expert placement under heterogeneous\nresource constraints. It introduces a data-driven, activation-aware placement\nalgorithm that balances local coverage and memory usage across servers,\nalongside a lightweight migration mechanism that adapts expert assignments\nunder evolving workloads.

An effective approach\nfor practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration\ncuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative\nprocess demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed\nframework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining\nlarge language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)\ninitializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer\nagent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal\nsolution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification\nset; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary\ncrossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative\nreduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard\ninteger programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%\nwithin a fixed time.

Existing GDA systems, however,\nmeasure WAN BW statically and independently between data centers (DCs), while\ndata transfer occurs dynamically and simultaneously among DCs during workload\nexecution. Also, they use a single connection WAN BW that cannot capture actual\nWAN capacities between distant DCs. Such inaccurate WAN BWs yield sub-optimal\ndecisions, inflating overall query latency and cost. In this paper, we present\nWANify, a new framework that precisely and dynamically gauges achievable\nruntime WAN BW using a machine learning prediction scheme, decision tree-based\nRandom Forest. This helps GDA systems make better decisions yielding reduced\nlatency and costs including WAN BW monitoring costs. Based on predicted runtime\nWAN BW, WANify determines the optimal number of heterogeneous parallel\nconnections for data transfer among DCs. This approach improves performance\nwithout additional, or even at reduced cost, by fully exploiting available WAN\ncapacities. In addition, WANify considers dynamics like network and workloads,\nand heterogeneity like skewed data, heterogeneous compute resources, and a\nvarying number of DCs while making decisions. The WANify prototype running on\nstate-of-the-art GDA systems is evaluated on AWS with 8 geo-distributed DCs.\nResults show that WANify enhances WAN throughput by balancing between the\nstrongest and weakest WAN links, enabling GDA systems to reduce latency and\ncost by up to 26% and 16% respectively with minimal effort, all while handling\ndynamics and heterogeneity efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "WANify\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(RF)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uc810\uc758 WAN \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uae30\uc885 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec GDA\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 GDA \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc13c\ud130 \uac04 WAN \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc744 \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\u00b7\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5f0\uacb0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\ub9cc \uace0\ub824\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3d9\uc2dc\u00b7\ub2e4\uc911 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130/\uc791\uc5c5 \ubc30\uce58 \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "WANify\ub294 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2ec\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c WAN \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 Random Forest\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 BW\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc13c\ud130 \uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uae30\uc885 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\u00b7\uc791\uc5c5 \ub3d9\uc801\uc131 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\ucef4\ud4e8\ud2b8\u00b7DC \uc218\uc758 \uc774\uae30\uc885\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AWS\uc758 8\uac1c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 DC \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, WAN \ub9c1\ud06c \uac04 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucda4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc804\uccb4 WAN \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 \uac01\uac01 26%\u00b716%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc808\uac10\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801\u00b7\uc774\uae30\uc885 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "WANify\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc5f0\uacb0 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c WAN \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 GDA\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Our results show that\nDINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and\nsystemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on\nexternal datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach\nprovides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.\nDespite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension\nin external cohort remains challenging.

Numerous deep\nlearning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively\nacquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and\nphotoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model\nperformance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The\nstudy introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning\nscheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a\ncomputational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully\nachieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds\nfor a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a\nlarge-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data\nsegments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and\n31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better\nperformance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg\nand mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these\npromising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance\nvariations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions,\nhighlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and\ndiverse population.

Sobel"], "title": "Congested Clique Counting for Local Gibbs Distributions", "comment": null, "summary": "There are well established reductions between combinatorial sampling and\ncounting problems (Jerrum, Valiant, Vazirani TCS 1986). Building off of a very\nrecent parallel algorithm utilizing this connection (Liu, Yin, Zhang arxiv\n2024), we demonstrate the first approximate counting algorithm in the\nCongestedClique for a wide range of problems. Most interestingly, we present an\nalgorithm for approximating the number of $q$-colorings of a graph within\n$\\epsilon$-multiplicative error, when $q>\\alpha\\Delta$ for any constant\n$\\alpha>2$, in $\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ rounds. More\ngenerally, we achieve a runtime of\n$\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ rounds for approximating the\npartition function of Gibbs distributions defined over graphs when simple\nlocality and fast mixing conditions hold. Gibbs distributions are widely used\nin fields such as machine learning and statistical physics. We obtain our\nresult by providing an algorithm to draw $n$ random samples from a distributed\nMarkov chain in parallel, using similar ideas to triangle counting (Dolev,\nLenzen, Peled DISC 2012) and semiring matrix multiplication (Censor-Hillel,\nKaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela PODC 2015). Aside from counting problems,\nthis result may be interesting for other applications requiring a large number\nof samples. In the special case of estimating the partition function of the\nhardcore model, also known as counting weighted independent sets, we can do\neven better and achieve an $\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ round\nalgorithm, when the fugacity $\\lambda \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta-1}$, where\n$\\alpha$ is an arbitrary constant less than $1$.", "AI": {"tldr": "CongestedClique \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\ud569\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\u2194\uacc4\uc218\ud654(Counting) \ud658\uc6d0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \uacc4\uc218\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc. \ud2b9\ud788 q>\u03b1\u0394 (\u03b1>2)\uc77c \ub54c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 q-\uc0c9\uc0c1 \uc218\ub97c \u03b5-\ubc30 \uc624\ucc28\ub85c \u00d5(n^{1/3}/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uadfc\uc0ac. \uc77c\ubc18 Gibbs \ubd84\ud3ec(\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\u00b7\ube60\ub978 \ud63c\ud569 \uac00\uc815)\uc640 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\u03bb \u2264 \u03b1/(\u0394-1), \u03b1<1)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac01\uac01 \u00d5(n^{1/3}/\u03b5^2) \ubc0f \u00d5(1/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5bb\uc74c. \ubcd1\ub82c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 n\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "motivation": "\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uacc4\uc218\ud654 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud658\uc6d0(JVV)\uc744 \ubd84\uc0b0 CongestedClique \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud574, \ud1b5\uacc4\ubb3c\ub9ac\u00b7\uae30\uacc4\ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud655\ub960\ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 partition function \ubc0f \uc870\ud569\uc801 \uacc4\uc218 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801.", "method": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(Liu, Yin, Zhang 2024)\uacfc JVV \ud658\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud574 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uacc4. \uc0bc\uac01\ud615 \uce74\uc6b4\ud305 \ubc0f semiring \ud589\ub82c\uacf1\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ucc28\uc6a9\ud574 n\uac1c\uc758 \ub79c\ub364 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uacc4\uc218\ud654 \ud658\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9.", "result": "- q-\uc0c9\uc0c1 \uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac: q>\u03b1\u0394(\u03b1>2)\uc5d0\uc11c \u00d5(n^{1/3}/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\n- \uc77c\ubc18 Gibbs \ubd84\ud3ec(\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131+\ube60\ub978 \ud63c\ud569): \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\n- \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378: \u03bb \u2264 \u03b1/(\u0394-1), \u03b1<1\uc774\uba74 \u00d5(1/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\n\uc774\ub294 CongestedClique\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \uacc4\uc218\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ub4e4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc0b0\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ub7c9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \ubf51\ub294 \uc0c8 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub113\uc740 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uacc4\uc218\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 sublinear \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uadfc\uc0ac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ube60\ub978 \ud63c\ud569\u00b7\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\u00b7\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218(\u03b1, \u03bb)\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud6c4\uc18d \uacfc\uc81c\ub2e4."}}

Recent\nadvancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing\nrecommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in\noptimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive\ngeneration mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential\ndependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable\nfor generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single\nrequest session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a\nframework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance\ngenerative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework\nreformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,\nwhere each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,\nand then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative\ntask in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline\nintegrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial\nincremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and\nemphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our\nextensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale\nindustrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP\nrepresents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative\nrecommendation systems for e-commerce applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "TBGRecall\uc740 Next Session Prediction(NSP) \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ud615(retrieval) \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc138\uc158 \ud1a0\ud070+\uc544\uc774\ud15c \ud1a0\ud070 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \u2018\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc774\ub825 \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc778 + \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc810\uc9c4\ud559\uc2b5\u2019\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uacfc \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc131 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud574 \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 TaoBao \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9ac\uadf8\ub808\uc2dc\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc694\uccad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ud68c\uc218(\uc0dd\uc131)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac80\uc0c9(retrieval) \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc785\ub825\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc138\uc158 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc138\uc158 \ud1a0\ud070 + \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131(Next Session Prediction). \uc0dd\uc131\ud615 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ucd94\uac00. \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc778\ud55c \ub4a4 \ud655\ub960\uc801(partial stochastic) \uc99d\ubd84 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud574 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc131\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810.", "result": "\uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\uc640 TaoBao \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd94\ucc9c\uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8/\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uad00\ucc30.", "conclusion": "NSP \uae30\ubc18 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9ac\uadf8\ub808\uc2dc\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud574 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ud615 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4."}}

Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a\nsingle modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally\nacross modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve\npreviously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively\nleverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities?\nTo address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes\nModality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization\nto enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality\nknowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language\nmodel (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting\nnew LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental\nlearning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality\nand the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA).\nSpecifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance\ncompared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

The intent is not to prescribe\na single \"best\" design but to provide a lens for comparing different\napproaches.\n  Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected\nto concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net\nprotocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids\nand oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply\nlevels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases\nsuggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while\npreserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.\n  The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical\ndecisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent\npopulations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language\nmodels can be safely integrated into layered frameworks.

The latter continues the \"small model, big performance\" philosophy\nof Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the\nOpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a\nsubstantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter\nrange; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size.

Between a literature\ndigest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical\napplication potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science\nstudies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate\nLLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the\nassessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding\na specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable\narbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs\nwith questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a\nsolid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We\nexemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the\nprompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals\nas the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised\nperformance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of\nacademic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise\ntext comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone\nto poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is\nself-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This\nevidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is\nconsistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external\n(comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the\nvariations of the prompt.

However, UFL faces several challenges\nin practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed\n(non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and\ncommunication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise.\nPrevious UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which\nintroduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this\npaper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional\nComputing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight\ntraining and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to\ncommunication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve\nUFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal\nmethod addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On\nthe server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data\ndistribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves\nup to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in\ntraining, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on\naverage across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various\ntypes of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedUHD\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ub514\uba58\uc154\ub110 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(HDC)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5(UFL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ube44IID \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\uc5f0\uc0b0\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0\uc7a1\uc74c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacbd\ub7c9\u00b7\uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21\uc758 kNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubca1\ud130 \uc81c\uac70\uc640 \uc11c\ubc84 \uce21\uc758 \uac00\uc911 HDC \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "UFL\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ucf00\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uc2dc \ube44IID \ub370\uc774\ud130, \uc5e3\uc9c0\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c NN\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc5f0\uc0b0\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc7a1\uc74c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "FedUHD\ub294 HDC\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\u00b7\uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4. \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 kNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubca1\ud130 \uc81c\uac70\ub85c \ube44IID\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ubcc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc911 HDC \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c\uc368 \ub85c\uceec \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\uc804\uc1a1 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c FedUHD\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 173.6\u00d7, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 612.7\u00d7 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 271\u00d7 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \uae30\uc874 NN \uae30\ubc18 UFL \ub300\ube44 15.50% \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc7a1\uc74c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HDC \uae30\ubc18 FedUHD\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c NN \uae30\ubc18 UFL\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacc4\uc0b0\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub0ae\ucd94\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\u00b7\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\u00b7\ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\ub2e4."}}

To\nensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts\nfiltering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs,\nresulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data.\nIn order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a\ncomprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision\nlanguage models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and\nopen attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that\nvideo-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings,\nand there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging\neffective temporal information.

While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,\nthese models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible\nto implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to\nimprove multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization\nframework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,\nand training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both\ninfluence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in\nsmall models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and\nscaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline\nthat generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting\nthe hateful modality.

It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot\ncoordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent\ndecentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,\nespecially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these\nagents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental\ntemporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance\ndegradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for\nMAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding\ndecisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational\nawareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial\nfeatures and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions\nprediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more\ninformed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex\nmulti-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an\nautomatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical\nmap layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,\nshowcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.\nNotably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAPF-World\uc740 MAPF\uc6a9 autoregressive action world model\ub85c, \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc/\ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc18\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ucc45 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub9f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud574 SOTA \ud559\uc2b5\ud615 \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\u00b7\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud615 MAPF \ud574\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ubc18\uc751\ud615(policy)\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MAPF-World\ub294 autoregressive \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 action world model\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ubbf8\ub798(\uc0c1\ud0dc\u00b7\ud589\ub3d9)\ub97c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c, \ud611\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub9f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub85c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ud559\uc2b5\ud615 \uc194\ubc84\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc6b0\uc218(\ud2b9\ud788 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654). \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ub300\ube44 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30 96.5% \ucd95\uc18c, \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 92% \uc808\uac10\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uace0\ub428.", "conclusion": "\ud658\uacbd \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\u00b7\ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 world-model \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d MAPF\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Consequently, we assume that the watch time follows the\nExponential-Gaussian Mixture (EGM) distribution, where the exponential and\nGaussian components respectively characterize the skewness and diversity.\nAccordingly, an Exponential-Gaussian Mixture Network (EGMN) is proposed for the\nparameterization of EGM distribution, which consists of two key modules: a\nhidden representation encoder and a mixture parameter generator. We conducted\nextensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on the\nindustrial short-video feeding scenario of Xiaohongshu App to validate the\nsuperiority of EGMN compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.\nRemarkably, comprehensive experimental results have proven that EGMN exhibits\nexcellent distribution fitting ability across coarse-to-fine-grained levels.

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived\ngraph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or\nanomaly detection.

However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness\nof the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for\nGNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we\nsystematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge\nconstruction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and\nshape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to\nperform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on\ndermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance\nand efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised\nregimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute\nthe best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features\nconsistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised\nconfiguration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805\nwithout relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.\nWith the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to\n0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud53c\ubd80 \uc601\uc0c1(dermoscopy)\uc744 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\u2192\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658(\ubd84\ud560\u00b7\ud2b9\uc9d5\u00b7\uac04\uc120) \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcc4\ub85c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud574 GNN \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc218\uc900 \uc774\uc0c1\ud0d0\uc9c0(GLAD)\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658 \uc124\uacc4\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568. \uc0c9\uc0c1 \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uace0, \ud615\ud0dc\u00b7\ud14d\uc2a4\ucc98\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uba74 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70 \ube44\uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5(Unsupervised)\uc73c\ub85c AUC 0.805, \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \ub77c\ubca8\ub85c 0.872, \uc644\uc804 \uac10\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c 0.914\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud568.", "motivation": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1\ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 GNN\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\u2192\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc124\uacc4(\ubd84\ud560 \uae30\ubc95\u00b7\uac04\uc120 \uad6c\uc131\u00b7\ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc9d5)\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc870\ud569\uc774 GLAD\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c\uc9c0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ube44\uad50\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\ud560 \uc2a4\ud0b4, \uac04\uc120 \uad6c\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5, \uc0c9\uc0c1\u00b7\ud14d\uc2a4\ucc98\u00b7\ud615\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc720\ub798 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, SOTA GLAD \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: OCGTL \ub4f1)\uc73c\ub85c \uc21c\uc218 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4\u00b7\uc57d\uc9c0\ub3c4\u00b7\uc644\uc804\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "result": "\uc0c9\uc0c1 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \ud615\ud0dc\u00b7\ud14d\uc2a4\ucc98 \ucd94\uac00 \uc2dc \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1. \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uace0 AUC-ROC 0.805, \uc57d\uc9c0\ub3c4(\ud76c\uc18c \ub77c\ubca8) 0.872, \uc644\uc804\uc9c0\ub3c4 0.914 \ub2ec\uc131. \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\u2192\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 GLAD \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc870\ud569\uacfc \ub77c\ubca8 \uc774\uc6a9 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c GNN \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c."}}

Agents must not only gather and interpret\nvast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,\nweigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as\nhuman experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\n$\\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models.

In contrast, (social) allostasis\nproposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations\nto reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental\ndemands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This\npaper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic\nregulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,\nanalogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from\nboth the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic\nreconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across\nseveral dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that\nallostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage\nenvironmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to\nimproved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents.

Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically\nutilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in\ncontinuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation\nsystems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from\nthe continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt\npersonalized information within latent representations. In this work, we\npropose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation\nModel (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an\nasymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the\nmissing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is\nthen performed in an asymmetric latent feature space.

Standard\nFederated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to\nmodel divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase\nframework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated\ninitialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a\nfoundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent\nstarting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,\nwhere it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a\nheterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable\nregion of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a\nparallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that\nweights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine\nsimilarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the\nconverged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average\ntest accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming\npersonalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and\nmechanical fault datasets, respectively.

Experimental results indicate that\nAIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction\n(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\\% and 44.44\\%, respectively.

When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters)\ntrained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4%\nimprovement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural\nmodifications.

With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction\ntuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly\nfocus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker\ncharacteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to\ncomprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the\ncapacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker\ncharacteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among\nspeaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified\nframework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage\nin-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn\nspeaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context\ninstruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,\ndemonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template\ndesign, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context\nexamples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval\nstrategy, example ordering, and the number of examples.

We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient\nfinetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments\nsystematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation\nsets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its\nfinetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In\nparticular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between\nfinetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream\nperformance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the\nfinetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the\nimportance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between\ndifferent downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate\ncancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less\nlabeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image\nquality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained\nmodels may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This\nhighlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions\nbetween finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in\nfinetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the\nvalue of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully\nrealise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud504\ub85c\uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 MRI\uc6a9 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378(ProFound)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\uc758 \ub77c\ubca8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ube44\uc728\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\uace0, \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\u00b7\ubc30\ud3ec \uac04 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc\uc601\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130(\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud654\uc9c8)\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ud654\uc9c8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801.", "method": "ProFound(\uc804\ub9bd\uc120 MRI\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc124\uacc4. \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0/\uc800\ud654\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud310\ub3c5 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\u00b7\uc804\ub9bd\uc120\uc554 \uac80\ucd9c \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub77c\ubca8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815. \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00.", "result": "\ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud654\uc9c8 \ubd84\ud3ec \ucc28\uc774\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce68. \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uba70, \ud654\uc9c8\ube44\uac00 \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ub2ec\uc131. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba74 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ube44\uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568. \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4\ub85c \ud488\uc9c8 \uc77c\uce58\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub294 \uc0c1\uc774\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub77c\ubca8\u00b7\uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub824\uba74 \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc601\uc0c1 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uacc4\ub7c9\ud558\uace0 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ud488\uc9c8 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc218\ub9bd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."}}

We\nintegrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal\nfairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context\nlearning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance\nfairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10%\nimprovements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific\ncausal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves\nthese gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its\nefficiency in low-data regimes.

In this paper, we present\nthe Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the\neffectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different\ngame-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,\nlexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog\nquality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,\nand neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws\nto characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our\nfindings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions\nand higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater\nvocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf\nand Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained\nvocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives\ninfluence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for\nmeasuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems.

In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned,\nwithout the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale\nadapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity\nof adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited\ncompression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited\nrepresentational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we\npropose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer\ntensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of\ndiverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient\nadaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists\namong adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to\nformulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices.\nMoreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven\nadapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations.

Early BP benchmarks featured\nsynthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the\ncomplexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world\nimages, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image\nfeatures, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released\nBongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the\noriginal BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,\nhowever, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining\nevaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset\ncomposed of $5\\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts\nusing real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)\npipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually\ncurated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying\nconcepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and\nmanually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended\nconcepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,\nincluding binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer\ngeneration.

Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and\nlearning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how\nagents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to\nmaximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative\nmodel of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have\nbeen proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they\nall share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an\nappropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their\ndesirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past\nmotor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents\nare assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan\nfor the future.

For\nproduct understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures\ndrive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one\nalignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue\nthat generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant\npotential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,\nachieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:\nthe lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the\ncommon presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a\nstandard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the\nfirst generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation\nlearning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for\ntargeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)\neffectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the\ndistraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the\nspecialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity\nof negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark\nMBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model\ndemonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the\npublic dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream\ntasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute\nprediction.

Convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while\nTransformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address\nthis trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure\nCNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel\nBlock (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes\nchannel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel\nattention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip\nconvolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced\ncomplexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,\nand non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a\ncross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their\ncomplementarity.

In this paper, we investigate two key\naspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally\ndesigned for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning\nstrategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that\nscanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield\npromising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of\nattention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is\nefficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid\narchitecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional\nAttention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its\neffectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses\nglobal information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict\nlocal modeling.

Existing CRE methods mainly\nuse memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.\nHowever, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can\nreveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we\npropose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) in CRE.

In addition, leveraging the\nadvantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel\ninstruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct\ncurrent cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an\ninstruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new\nrelations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model\non TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new\nstate-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating\nthe importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd08\uae30 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc815\uc624 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud574 \uc624\ub958 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38 \ucd94\uc885 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\uc5ec CRE \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 CRE\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub9ac\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc640 \ub300\uc870\ud559\uc2b5 \uc704\uc8fc\ub85c \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \uc624\ub958 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\ub294 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801 \uad50\uc815\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\u00b7\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd08\uae30 \uc751\ub2f5\uc774 \uc815\ub2f5\uc778\uc9c0\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud574 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c(dual-task) \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc9c0\uc2dc-\uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uad50\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TACRED\uc640 FewRel\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 CRE \ub300\ube44 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 SOTA\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc624\ub958 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38 \uae30\ubc18 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba74 CRE\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9dd\uac01 \uc644\ud654\uc640 \uc2e0\uaddc \uad00\uacc4 \uc801\uc751 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\u00b7\uc9c0\uc2dc \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\uc7a1\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."}}

Traditional forecasting methods typically\nconstruct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to\npredict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic\nemissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method\ntend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference.\nTo address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling\n(SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the\npredictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse\nfeatures at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet\ncomplementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature\ndecomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the\nscale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional\nlinear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary\nusing gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is\nconstructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on\ncross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results,\nsuppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic\nemission prediction.

These limitations\nresult in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through\ngoal-oriented reasoning steps.

Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for\nconstructing training data that effectively captures the underlying\nprobabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict\nconfidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.\nFurthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that\nleverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation\nfor the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies\nfor identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the\ngeneration process.

However, traditional VG struggles with\nsome scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this\ngap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal\nQueries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,\nvideo segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:\nlimited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,\nwhere dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose\nOVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)\nthat retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a\ncross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant\nmodalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle\nhybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct\nQVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries.

Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely\non scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between\nobjectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method\nthat decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable\ncomponents.

While existing safety methods, such as\nprompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they\noften introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent\nlocalization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on\nexplicit ``concept replacement\" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To\naddress these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress\nparadigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first\nprecisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B\nsubstitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the\ngenerative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe,\ncontext-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training\nstrategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily\navailable, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to\nlearn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at\ninference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations.

A single OOD detector may not\nprevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an\nideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the\ninherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to\npredict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also,\nsystematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even\nimpractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a\nmeta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal\nsettings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model\nbehaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with\nminimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with\nhandcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal\ncharacteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance\nacross diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors\nfor a new data distribution shift.

Finally,\nMantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the\nactionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.\nTogether, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for\nnext-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and\ndeployable where traditional models fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mantis\ub294 4\uc5b5+ \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc77c\uc218\ub85c\ub9cc \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc9c8\ubcd1\ubcc4 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c8\ubcd1\u00b7\uc9c0\uc5ed\u00b7\uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc989\uc2dc \uc608\uce21\ud558\uba70 CDC \ud5c8\ube0c \ud3ec\ud568 39\uac1c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uace0 8\uc8fc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ub450 \ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1 \ub298\ub9bc.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uc885 \ubc1c\ubcd1\uc774\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uac10\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc9c8\ubcd1\ubcc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\ub9de\ucda4 \ud6c8\ub828\u00b7\uc804\ubb38 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubc1b\uc74c. \ubc94\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc989\uc2dc \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4\u00b7\uc804\ud30c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\u00b7\uac1c\uc785\u00b7\uad00\uce21 \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c 4\uc5b5+ \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc77c\uc218\ub85c \uae30\uacc4\uc801(\uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc2a4\ud2f1) \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559 \ub4dc\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub428.", "result": "6\uac1c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c CDC Forecast Hub\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 39\uac1c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub300\ube44 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \uc77c\ubd80 \uc804\ud30c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubc30\uc81c\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc74c. 8\uc8fc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\ub2a5 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc5f0\uc7a5\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uacc4\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub52a\ud788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc94\uc6a9\uc131\u00b7\ud574\uc11d\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\u00b7\ubc30\ud3ec\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uac10\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ub420 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc74c."}}

We systematically\nevaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and\nDeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning\ndiverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with\nthinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish\nlogarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a\npredictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings\nidentify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)\nsuitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering\noptimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and\nhigh-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.\nNotably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from\nextended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger\nmodels, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides\ngreater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific\npatterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring\nsignificantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory\nmedicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our\nproposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of\nthinking budget concepts across architectures.

Accepted to HAIPS @ CCS 2025", "summary": "Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of\nprivacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a\npromising approach $\\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in\nother subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$\nparadigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language\nevaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.\nRecognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we\ninvestigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the\nprivacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM\nevaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text.

While\nexisting self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are\nconstrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to\noverconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training\ncollapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary\nCollective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model\ncollaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF\noptimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective\nConsistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides\nreward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is\nweighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident\nmodels contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse\noutput distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF\nenables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability\nthrough coevolution.

To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a\nhierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)\ninspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation\nlearning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the\nhierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of\ninterdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by\nword embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied\nto learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the\nentire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted\nhierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding\ninter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation\nmatrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in\ngraphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The\nRe-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical\ntransformations.

Multi-scale features are\ncritical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature\nlearning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware\nlayers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be\nconducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This\npaper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood\nbased on knowledge distillation.

Analysis and Applications", "comment": "Ph.D. Thesis", "summary": "Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose\nrepresentations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five\nyears have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and\nsupervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream\ntasks.\n  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the\nknowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis\nframework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the\nacoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a\ncomparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also\nshows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream\ntask performance.\n  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on\nspeech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to\nspoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding\nthan widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration\nof SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this\nthesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)\nand named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding\nEvaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find\nthat end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded\n(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate\nE2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on\ntask performance.\n  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,\nproviding tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the\ncommunity to make informed design choices for future model development and\nadoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc74c\uc131 \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378(SFM)\uc758 \uce35\ubcc4 \uc74c\ud5a5\u00b7\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, SLU(\ud2b9\ud788 \uc74c\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uccb4\uba85 \uc778\uc2dd/\uc704\uce58\ud654)\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 E2E SFM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SFM\ub4e4\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud588\uc73c\ub098 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ucd95\uc801\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2ec\uce35\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 SLU \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uacfc \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec SFM\uc758 \uce35\ubcc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\uace0, SLU \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc74c\uc131 NER \ubc0f NEL \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c SLEE \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c SFM \uae30\ubc18 E2E \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \uce90\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc(ASR\u2192\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uce35\ubcc4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc74c\ud5a5\u00b7\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud588\uace0, E2E SFM \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\ubd80 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uce90\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \uc5f0\uacc4\ub428\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SFM \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\u00b7\ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 SLU\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\uc120\ud0dd\u00b7\uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uacb0\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing methods often\nsuffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling\nand supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their\nactual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a\nmoment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated\ndataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually\nannotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the\nexpression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens\nvideo-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to\nguide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building\nupon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a\nmoment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and\ntracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a\nmoment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level\nSelective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises\nonly the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.\nThis selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces\nlanguage-conditioned learning.

Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of\nthe generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,\nthus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not\napplicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on\ninaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation\nerrors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing\nresources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we\npropose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).\nSince allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content\naccuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this\nsensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource\ntradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all\nusers with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution\nspace that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with\nlow complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the\nLP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original\nthree-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while\nimproving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to\nexisting DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F\nconverges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,\nimproving AvgCAQA by more than 14%.

The FOFPID\ncontroller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order\ndynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle\na person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's\nparameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions,\nwhich boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient\nprofiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional\nOrder PID (FOPID) controller.

While recent advances have made impressive progress, most\nmethods still unify all background elements into a single representation,\nhindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some\napproaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on\npre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to\ndiscrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor\nscenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving\nscenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian\nSplatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic\ndriving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D\nfeature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives.

Despite its importance, the current Intelligent\nJudicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation\nprediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation\neligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a\ncomprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the\nexisting research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which\noften overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into\ndeep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct\nstages.

However, most automated methods estimate\nlandmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even\nsmall shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant\nmeasurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent\nsemi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining\nlandmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated\nAnatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To\nenable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in\nthis work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised\nB-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV\nlong axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this\nfoundation, we introduce \\textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet\nmanually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then\nautomatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.\n\\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the\nmotion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the\npotential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2ec\uc7a5 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c B-\ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c LV \uc120\ud615 \uce21\uc815\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uce68\uc0c1 \uae30\uc800\ubd80\ub97c \uac00\ub85c\uc9c0\ub974\ub294 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc2a4\uce94\ub77c\uc778(SL)\uc5d0 \uc218\uc9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 B-\ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \uc704\uce58 \uc624\ucc28\uac00 \ud070 \uce21\uc815 \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc84c\uc73c\ub098, EnLVAM\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\uac00 \uc815\ud55c SL\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub450\uc5b4 AMM(Anatomical Motion Mode) \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud588\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc57d\uc9c0\ub3c4\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc724\uacfd \uc778\uc2dd\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 SL\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uc704\uc5d0\uc11c AMM \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\u00b7\uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c WiseLVAM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c SL \ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 B-\ubaa8\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \uc704\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654\ub3c4 LV \uc9c1\uc120 \uce58\uc218 \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.

This effect arises from the coupling between\nstate-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space\ndynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for\nleaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes\nexplicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient\npropagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in\nparameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory\nretention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners\nthat adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal\nanalogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as\nAdam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.\nNumerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,\nsupporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting\nsystematic effects on training dynamics.

Parametric projections make it\npossible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire\nprojection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data\ninstances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with\nout-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we\npropose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy\n(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections.

We conduct quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as\nbaseline projection methods.

Fine-Grained Evaluation of Conflicting Answers in Question-Answering", "comment": "no comments", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in question\nanswering (QA) tasks. However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a\nquestion may have several valid answers, remains challenging. Traditional QA\nsettings often assume consistency across evidences, but MAQA can involve\nconflicting answers. Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is\ncostly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic\ndata, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated\nannotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA\nsetting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to\ndetect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we\nintroduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking\ndatasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware\nMAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs.

Existing planning frameworks remain\ninadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data\ngranularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by\nfirst proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem\n(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale\nspatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure\ncapacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated\nPlanning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors\nand dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter\ntuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning\nsolutions.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the\noriginal ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of\napproximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.\nWithout modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number\nof additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding\ncompression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the\nself-compression stage.

Knowledge Graphs (KGs)\noffer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated\nreasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods\noften rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively\naggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical\ncorpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty\nof evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a\nLLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.\nLeveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we\nsimulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time\nseries. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two\nspecialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor\nAgent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via\nsampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions\nand inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally\nintegrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by\nconfidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve\nconflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational\ntriples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts\ndemonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To\nevaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question\nanswering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing\nsignificant improvements over non-augmented baselines.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model,\ndubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative\nperspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames\nvia temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into\nplausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features.\nClassifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in\ndenoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to\nassess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity.\nExperiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard\nbenchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event\nboundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffGEBD\ub294 \ub3d9\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uacbd\uacc4 \uac80\ucd9c\uc744 \ud655\uc0b0(denoising diffusion) \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud574, \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uac04 \ubcc0\ud654(temporal self-similarity)\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub514\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\ub958\uae30-\ud504\ub9ac \uac00\uc774\ub358\uc2a4\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uc870\uc808\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging\nfor LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user\nrequest, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this\nchallenge, we propose \\texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance\nthe tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \\texttt{GTool}\nconstructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and\ngenerate the \\texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency\ninformation understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction\ntask is designed to improve the reliability of \\texttt{GTool} with incomplete\ndependencies.

There is certain work aiming to optimize the\nmemory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads\ncan be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and\nstreaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the\nstreaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would\nlargely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However,\nsince employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one\nlarge round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly\nbring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition,\nwe impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval\nand streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively\nretrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer.

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning.

As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues\nto expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or\ninternal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,\ndistinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a\npromising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such\nas basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide\nexperimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics\ngrounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for\nstudying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable\nsetting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,\nespecially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics\nforecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can\nlearn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics\nforecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such\ncapability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations\nusing sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features\ncaptured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These\nfindings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs\nduring in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that\nbroadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uacc4\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 in-context learning(ICL) \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc785\ub825 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 residual stream activation\uc744 sparse autoencoders(SAE)\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc SAE\uac00 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ub7c9\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc989, ICL \uc911\uc5d0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uac1c\ub150\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ICL\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud1b5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc5ed\ud559 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ICL\uc758 \uae30\uc81c\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801.", "method": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uacc4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc608\uce21(task)\uc73c\ub85c ICL \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc785\ub825 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 residual stream \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec SAE\ub85c \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ub4e4\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\ub7c9(\uc608: \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0) \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, SAE\uac00 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c \uc77c\ubd80 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcc0\uc218(\ud2b9\ud788 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0)\uc640 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\ud45c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 ICL\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c \ud328\ud134\ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud574\uc11d\u00b7\uc6d0\uc778 \uaddc\uba85 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd9c\ubc1c\uc810\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which\nemulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual\ntransformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end\nframework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming,\nand reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline\nthat generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an\n''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and\nrigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning\ncapabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable\nparadigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first\nin-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering\ninsights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing\nadditional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and\nmagnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual\nreasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise\nvisual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or\nregions, further enhancing its capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM\uc5d0 \uc778\ud130\ub9ac\ube0c\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac01-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860(\ud06c\ub86d\u00b7\ud655\ub300\u00b7\uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c Simple o3\ub294 SFT \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131(observe-reason-act)\uacfc TWI-Tools-146K \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub418\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc55e\uc11c\uba70 \uc138\ubd80 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 MLLM\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc88b\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae34 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01(Chain-of-Thought, CoT)\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\u2014\ud2b9\ud788 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc870\uc791(\ud06c\ub86d/\ud655\ub300/\uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub4f1)\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc11e\uc5b4 \uc4f0\ub294\u2014\ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.

To tackle this,\nhypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph\nlearning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite\nthe proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for\nHNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in\nseveral aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks;\n(ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent\ndataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder\ncomparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets\nspanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art\nHNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols.\nOur benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms\nof four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness.\nFurther, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use\nlibrary for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive\nexperiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent\nlimitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions\nfor future research.

These high-quality\npreference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA.

While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken\nconventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against\npatch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that\nremain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either\noverfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit\ngeneralization vulnerability. We introduce \\textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level\nquantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of\npatch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature\nDisalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing\nperceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient\nPerceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients\nacross bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge\nIoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training\nProtocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme\nacross multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over\n40\\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean\naccuracy.

Workshop name: \"What is Next in Multimodal\n  Foundation Models?\"", "summary": "Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language\nModels (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for\na wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained\nembeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where\nstate-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated\ndomain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose\nvisual and cross-modal capabilities.\n  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve\noptimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the\npretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual\nlearning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization\ntechniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective\ncombination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet\ncritical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure\nreproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained\nmodels.

Cine MRI extends this by\ncapturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To\nreduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have\nbeen utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural\nRepresentation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction\nby learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling\nhigh-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily\nfocus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping,\nwhile overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its\nneighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method\noperating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes\nthe positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from\nlocal multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By\nenabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values\nfrom both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging\nCartesian k-space data.

However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which\nis a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely\nimpedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are\ninherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to\nevade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with\nvarying scales.

However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic\ntoken level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between\nvariables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or\nsatisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce\ncausal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning\nframework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a\ndataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an\ninput question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated\nanswer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves\nthe causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on\nCLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces\nthe hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements.

To address these limitations, we propose\nForeground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric\nthat classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our\nmethod reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:\n(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of\nsimilar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend\nbeyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation\nmethods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local\nmemorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions.

However, their effectiveness in\ndownstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive\ndatasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose\nCorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE\nactivations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only\ninference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding\nspurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average\nactivations, automating the entire pipeline.

However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on\npredefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life\nscenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,\nthis paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly\nlearns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement\nlearning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based\nmulti-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect\nfuture-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is\nsubsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we\nincorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further\nenhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's\nresponses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two\npublic ESC datasets.

The Avengers-Pro\nembeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable\nmodel based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks\nand 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and\nClaude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a\nperformance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single\nmodel (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the\naverage accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach\n~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a\nPareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost,\nand the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models.

OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided\nactor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.\nIts key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action\nsub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.\nTraining occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers\nState, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is\nbuilt on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,\nScalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500\nunseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible\ninefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,\nthe system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring\nDashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This\nwork presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing\nhow context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and\nmeasurable human impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "OPTIC-ER\uc740 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\u00b7\uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc751\uae09\ucd9c\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758(attention)-\uae30\ubc18 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud48d\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubca1\ud130\uc640 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158(\ub098\uc774\uc9c0\ub9ac\uc544 \ub9ac\ubc84\uc2a4 \uc8fc \ub370\uc774\ud130, \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\uac04 \uc544\ud2c0\ub77c\uc2a4 \uac00\uc18d\ud654)\uc5d0\uc11c 500\uac74\uc758 \ubbf8\uc751\ub2f5 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc544\ud504\ub9ac\uce74 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae34 \uc751\uae09\ub300\uc751 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc778\uba85\u00b7\uace0\ud1b5 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd9c\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ub9ac\uce58 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubca1\ud130(\ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc900\ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \ud3ec\ud568), \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ubc8c\uc810\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc815\ubc00 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4, \uc0ac\uc804\uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\uac04 \uc544\ud2c0\ub77c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5.

Early efforts to\nidentify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual\ncontent itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and\nfactually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to\nuncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced\nlinguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between\nLLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted.

We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that\nreplaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an\nONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL\nsamples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features\n(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),\nand requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers\nimmediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying\nNGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained\nobject earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against\nLRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial\nworkloads.

Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with\nnegligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and\ninfrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the\ndamage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with\npixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel\nWeather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of\n14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding\nground truth annotations and weather labels.

At inference\ntime, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no\nretraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving\nthe accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen\nLLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615\uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\ub4e4\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9-\uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac19\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9-\uac10\uc218\uc131 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c CSCR\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub85c\uadf8\uc787\u00b7\ud37c\ud50c\ub809\uc11c\ud2f0 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ube60\ub974\uac8c k-NN\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucd08 \ub808\uc774\ud134\uc2dc\uc640 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ubcc4 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubb34\uc2dc, \uace0\ube44\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1, \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9d1\ud569 \uac00\uc815, \ub610\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8\uc787 \ubc1c\uc790\uad6d, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 API\uc5d0\ub294 \ud37c\ud50c\ub809\uc11c\ud2f0 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \ub300\ube44 \ud559\uc2b5(contrastive encoder)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc34\ub4dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \ub3d9\uc77c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub0b4\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc6b0\uc120\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860\uc2dc FAISS \uc778\ub371\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 k-NN \uc870\ud68c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 25%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4-\ube44\uc6a9 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 LLM\uacfc OOD(\ubd84\ud3ec\uc678) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \ud480 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc2dc \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\ud544\uc694, \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucd08 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "CSCR\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ub300\ube44 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud480\uacfc \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

E-graph extraction is a challenging\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem.

However,\ntraditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches\noffer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal\nsolutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We\npresent e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key\ninnovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data\ndependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded\nperformance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space\npruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only\npromising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving\nnear-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the\nreduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,\nguiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.\n  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis\nfields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact\napproaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art\nextraction framework (SmoothE).

However, classical LRTR-based methods face\ntwo critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is\nlow-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with\nsignificant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete\nmeshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our\napproach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation\nthat semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics\nthan holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This\ndesign not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances\nadaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel\nasymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific\nfactor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized\nheads.

To address this\nlimitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond\nto user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information\nof regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose\nRegion-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which\nincorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to\nutilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual\ncontent with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we\nintroduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset\nthat covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\\&P-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal\npersonalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free\nevaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the\nregion-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL\nmodels with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models.

Existing reasoning datasets often\neither lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit\nrobust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd\nReasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive\nraw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary\nchallenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of\na Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human\neducators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design\nlogics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these\ndesign logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create\nreasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing\ndatasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning\ndatasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),\ncontaining 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,\nand Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging\nquestions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the\nquestions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty\nand diversity than those in the baseline datasets.

In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on\noperations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are\nincompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed\nSNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and\nhardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of\nbinary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic\nBlock (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual\nlearning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)\nmodule introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication\nand highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.\nComplementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further\nimproves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature\ninteraction across views within a spike-compatible framework.

However, a critical challenge remains: the\nsemantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their\ncorresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,\nwhere semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift\nduring SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale\ndatabases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL\nfirst performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the\ntables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.\nIt then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution\nDescription Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This\nreformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,\nleveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic\ndeviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain\nbenchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and\nscalability.

Furthermore, we\ndesign inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images\ninto a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to\nalleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping\nfunction in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image\nfeatures from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image\nfeatures for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization\nability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of\nlearnable prompts.

In\nthis work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and\nbenchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction,\nconstrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design\nspace into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and\ngraph featurization.

Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal\nfiltering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,\nalternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as\nincorporating lagged dynamics.

However,\ncurrent evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically\nanalyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within\nthese systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative\nprogrammable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents.

We challenge this assumption by\ndemonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant\nvariety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,\ncan actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive\ncausal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the\ninternal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key\ncontribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously\nestimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling\nprojection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a\ncase due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the\nbroader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy\nfor generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.\nAcross 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9\nchrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured\ntradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal\nevidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict\ngenerative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric\nand information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,\noffering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related\nlanguage families and, more broadly, for controlling representational\nallocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSA(\ud45c\uc900 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc790\uc6d0 \ud45c\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \uc5bd\ud798\uc774 \ubc29\uc5b8 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0, \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \uc911 \ud45c\uc900\uc5b4 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud574 \ud22c\uc601\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud574 \ubc29\uc5b8 \uae30\uacc4\ubc88\uc5ed \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc790\uc6d0 \ud45c\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub828 \ubcc0\uc885(\ubc29\uc5b8) \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub3c4\uc6c0\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\uc900\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \uc9c0\ubc30\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\ub824 \ud568.", "method": "\ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900\uc5b4(MSA) \uad00\ub828 \ud45c\ud604 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ud504\ub85c\ube59(framework)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ud574\ub2f9 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub85c\uc758 \ud22c\uc601\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac(decoupling)\ud558\ub294 \ud22c\uc601 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc218\ud589.", "result": "\uc544\ub78d\uc5b4 25\uac1c \ubc29\uc5b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 +4.9 chrF++(\ud3c9\uade0 +2.0) \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud45c\uc900\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc190\uc2e4\ub418\ub294 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uad00\uce21\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uace0\uc790\uc6d0 \ud45c\uc900\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc9c0\ubc30\uac00 \uad00\ub828 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \ubcc0\uc885\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc624\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\u00b7\uc815\ubcf4\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ube59\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \uac1c\uc785\uc774 \uba40\ud2f0\uc5b8\uc5b4\u00b7\ub2e4\uc911\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 LLM\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

When expensive high-dimensional\ndynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic\nloss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,\nhistory-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics\nfrom time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework\nusing the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by\nconstruction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a\ndiscrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium\nstatistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before\nspecializing to a particle discretization.

This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to\njointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from\nRGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based\nvideo inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single\nocclusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while\npreserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D\nMorphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate\n3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout\nthe pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the\nrecovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining\nfacial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs.\nAblation studies further show that the framework remains robust across\ndifferent landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse\nlandmark configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e8\uc77c RGB \ubdf0\uc640 \ud55c \uc7a5\uc758 \ube44\uac00\ub9bc(occlusion)-\ud504\ub9ac \ucc38\uc870 \ud504\ub808\uc784, \ubc00\uc9d1 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c \uc720\ub3c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 HMD\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 3DMM \uae30\ubc18 \uc644\uc804\ud55c 3D \uc5bc\uad74\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294, \uae30\ud558 \uc778\uc9c0\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "HMD \ucc29\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5bc\uad74 \uc0c1\ub2e8\uc774 \uac00\ub824\uc9c0\uba74 \uc601\uc0c1\uae30\ubc18 \uc6d0\uaca9\ud68c\uc758 \ub4f1 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 XR \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc815\u00b7\uc2dc\uc120 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc190\uc2e4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ubab0\uc785\uac10\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c RGB \ub2e8\uc77c \ubdf0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc815\u00b7\ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 3D \uc5bc\uad74\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "GAN \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc00\uc9d1 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc624\ud074\ub8e8\uc804-\ud504\ub9ac \ucc38\uc870 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc190 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c SynergyNet \uacc4\uc5f4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c 3DMM \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ud68c\uadc0\ud574 3D \uc5bc\uad74\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ubc00\uc9d1 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 RGB \uc5bc\uad74 \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c HMD\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\uccb4\uc131(identity)\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4\uac10\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ud3ec\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc\ud55c 3D \uc5bc\uad74 \uae30\ud558\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ube14\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc00\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\uac74\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\ubc00\uc9d1 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ucc38\uc870 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uae30\ud558 \uc778\uc9c0\ud615 \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305\uacfc 3DMM \ud68c\uadc0\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c, HMD\ub85c \uac00\ub824\uc9c4 \uc5bc\uad74\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubcf5\uc6d0 \ubc0f 3D \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \ubcf4\uc874 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4."}}

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts.

We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit).

Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of\npre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the\nmisalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the\nmodel's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction\nlearning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting\nthe conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we\nspecifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space\nshifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic\nconcepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a\nvisual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction\nbetween visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing\ndiscrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery\nfeature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies\nto minimize redundant forgery information.

We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of\nneural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches\ninfinity.

Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens,\nreducing LLM usage and communication costs.

Existing research has mostly\nfocused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how\nto interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of\ncapturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and\nthe target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is\ncrucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic\nmotion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction\nlocalization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,\nbut suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although\ncurrent temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting\nverb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training\nand exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation\nmoments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed\nEgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric\nvideos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate\nhigh-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify\ncontact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide\nclosed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for\nobject masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot\nimplementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel\nbenchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric\nvideos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream\napplications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to\nevaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR\nsignificantly enhances problem-solving performance.

The complexity of visual\ndata introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious\ncorrelations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of\noverfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this\nmakes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust\nagents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we\npropose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We\npropose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline\ndata to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a\ndiffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method\nacross both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces\n(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without\nrequiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods.

We evaluate\nthe impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an\norchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between\nagents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by\n18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce\nerrors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms\nachieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute\nimprovement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results\nhighlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective\norchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc744 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud574 \u2018\ub178\ud2b8\ubd81\u2019(\uacf5\uc720 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c)\uacfc \u2018\uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ud130\u2019(\uc870\uc815\uc790)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568. \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81\uc740 \ud658\uac01(hallucination) \uc624\ub958\ub97c 18% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud558\uc704\uc601\uc5ed \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 13.5% \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc904\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 7.5%\uc5d0\uc11c 25%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud568.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30\u00b7\ubcf5\ud569 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc0c1\uc138 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\uc9c0\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874 \uc81c\uc57d \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning\nhave significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,\nexisting methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial\nrelationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent\ninterpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,\nwe propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel\nframework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and\nmodels their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely\nprovides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring\npost-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and\ncross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,\nIPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the\nway for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.\nThe code is publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPGPhormer\ub294 \uc885\uc591 \ubbf8\uc138\ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc870\uc9c1 \ubc0f \uc138\ud3ec \uc218\uc900 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud504-\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec WSI \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc874 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud574\uc11d\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 multiple instance learning \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc874 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04\uad00\uacc4\uc640 \ub85c\uceec \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615\uc788\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ud574\uc11d\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "IPGPhormer\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1 \ub0b4 \uc138\ud3ec\u00b7\uc870\uc9c1 \ub2e8\uc704 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \uc138\ud3ec \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc11d\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc5c6\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 WSI\uc640 \ucf54\ud638\ud2b8 \uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud574\uc11d\uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IPGPhormer\ub294 \ud574\uc11d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc554 \uc608\ud6c4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c, \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

These\ntasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,\nperforming price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing\ncheckout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague\nrequirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible\nproducts. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or\nShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple\nshops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they\noriginate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall\nrequire longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining\nrepresentative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline\nagents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and\nunderlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The\nbest-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1\nscores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.\nWebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to\npromote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "WebMall\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud06c\ub864\ub9c1\ub41c \uc0c1\ud488\uc744 \ub123\uc740 4\uac1c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0c1\uc810\uacfc 91\uac1c \uad50\ucc28-\uc0c1\uc810 \uc1fc\ud551 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ube44\uad50 \uc1fc\ud551 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8/\uace0\uae09 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub124\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\u00b7\ucd94\ub860\u00b7\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uace0 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \uacfc\uc81c \uc644\ub8cc\uc728 75%/F1 87%, \uace0\uae09 53%/F1 63%\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\u00b7\uad6c\ub9e4 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uad50\ucc28 \uc0c1\uc810 \ube44\uad50\uc640 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud488 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Common Crawl\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc0c1\ud488 \uc624\ud37c\ub85c \ucc44\uc6b4 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0c1\uc810\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \uae30\ubcf8(\uac80\uc0c9\u00b7\ube44\uad50\u00b7\uc7a5\ubc14\uad6c\ub2c8\u00b7\uacb0\uc81c)\uacfc \uace0\uae09(\ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\u00b7\ub300\uccb4\ud488\u00b7\ud638\ud658\uc131 \ud0d0\uc0c9)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 91\uac1c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4. \uad00\ucc30 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\u00b7\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\u00b7\uae30\ubc18 LLM(GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4)\uc744 \ub2ec\ub9ac\ud55c 8\uac1c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "result": "\uae30\ubcf8 \uacfc\uc81c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728 75%\u00b7F1 87%, \uace0\uae09 \uacfc\uc81c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728 53%\u00b7F1 63%.

However, existing research primarily focuses on refining\nensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration\nof ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To\naddress this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate\nmodels, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce\nthe risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on\nthe idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack\nmethod tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates\naugmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head\ndropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated\nparameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented\nmodels are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we\nintroduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost\ntransferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack\nsignificantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based\nattacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

This\nlimitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal\ndeficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To\naddress this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'\nunderstanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core\nstages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,\nwhere an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic\nunits and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and\nAdaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or\noptimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments\non the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and\nsubstantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all\nevaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like \"Text\" and\n\"Composition\". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators\n(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with\nInfinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline\nInfinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each\nDeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting.

The field of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create\nsuch explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for\nskepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is\nexplanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in\ncomparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,\nbut still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to\nexplanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method\nrobustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the\nrobustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for\ntrustworthiness.

A Reasoning Distillation Method via Multi-LoRA Interaction", "comment": "Accepted by IJCAI2025", "summary": "Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nstrong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of\nparameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical\nreasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback.

Koes"], "title": "FlowMol3: Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Small-Molecule Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired\nproperties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of\napplications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing\nmodels that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present\nFlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the\nstate of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial\nperformance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes\nto the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching\nformulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three\narchitecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:\nself-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion.

Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and\nprompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.\nInspired by the notion that strategically generated \"additional\" information\ncan serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective\nContextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy\ndesigned to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an\nLVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary\nreasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are\nintelligently integrated with the original question to construct a\ncomprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt\nguides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.\nCrucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning\nof the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and\nScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms\nestablished baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant\naccuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual\nunderstanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and\ncompleteness of the generated answers.

To alleviate these problems, we propose\nScore-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in\nsmooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and\nto preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results\nshow that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by\n31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining\nmemory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic\ncontrol algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that\nintegrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,\nenabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.\nConsequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs\nwithout additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "SciNO\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uc21c\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub85c\uadf8 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \ud5e4\uc2dc\uc548 \ub300\uac01\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.

To address this, we propose S5,\nthe first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS,\nwhich unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically\nunderutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing\nlarge-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that\nintegrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the\nRS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by\npre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive\ncorpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and\nobject detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which\nenables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters.\nThis approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across\ndiverse RS benchmarks.

While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data\nheterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to\nnon-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource\nconstraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method\nthat dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on\ndistribution-aware embeddings.

Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly\nreducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and\ndiverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection\nand characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods\nunderutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby\nhindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to\nmodel the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI\nvolumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba),\nSRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and\ncombines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to\nconstruct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient\nvolumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to\nprogressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both\nthe coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features.

We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for\nproducing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research.

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the\ncreation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling\nshort of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint.\nIn this paper, we introduce \\textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic\npanorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control\nand synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN\nintegrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create\n360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a\nperspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,\nrespectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates\ncomprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene\nreconstruction, we propose a \\textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using\nmetric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our\nmethod ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the\nreconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually\ncompelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

We\nconclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving\nsolution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future\nintegrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance\nintelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucc28\ub7c9 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud45c\uc9c0\ud310 \uac80\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548. \ucc28\ub7c9\ubcc4\ub85c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\ud560\uacfc \uacbd\ub7c9 \uac1d\uccb4 \uac80\ucd9c\uae30\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ub85c\uceec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 FedProx, FedAdam, FedAVG \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud574 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud568. \uc11c\ubc84 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc, \ub85c\uceec epoch, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc728, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub4f1 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud568.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uacb0\u00b7\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\uc73c\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubd80\ub2f4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc911\uc559\uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\u00b7\uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "\ucc28\ub7c9\ubcc4\ub85c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud45c\uc9c0\ud310 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\ud560(\ubd80\ubd84\uc801 \ube44\uade0\uc77c \ubd84\ud3ec)\uacfc \uacbd\ub7c9 \uac1d\uccb4 \uac80\ucd9c\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub85c\uceec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589.

Understanding these divergences can inform the development of\nmore robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI)\nvision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is\nbased on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial\nvision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:\ndoes AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article\nexplores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,\nshape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these\nmodels, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern\nrecognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as\npixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By\nsystematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover\nalignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human\nperception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision\nsystems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding\ndistortions that undermine trust and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub17c\ubb38\ub4e4\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucc29\uc2dc\uc640 \uc778\uacf5\uc2dc\uac01\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec, \uc77c\ubd80 \ucc29\uc2dc \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc778\uacf5\ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ud604\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc AI \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 '\ud53d\uc140 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131'\uacfc \ud658\uac01 \uac19\uc740 \ud604\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04-\uce5c\ud654\uc801 AI \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\uac01\uc740 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud604\uc2e4\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294\ub370, AI\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc720\uc0ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ucc29\uc2dc\ub97c \uacbd\ud5d8\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \ud639\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uba74 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ube44\uc804 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc6c0\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc0c9\uc0c1\u00b7\ud06c\uae30\u00b7\ud615\ud0dc\u00b7\uc6b4\ub3d9 \ucc29\uc2dc \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \uc778\uacf5 \ube44\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378(\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc870\uac74)\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ube44\uad50. \ub300\uc0c1\uc5d0\ub294 \ud45c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc720\ub3c4 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc, \uc790\uc5f0\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \ucc29\uc2dc \uc720\uc0ac \ud6a8\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub428.", "result": "\uc77c\ubd80 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ucc29\uc2dc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ud604\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uace0, \ubc18\uba74 AI \uace0\uc720\uc758 \ud604\uc0c1(\ud53d\uc140 \uc218\uc900 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131, \ud658\uac01)\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5b4 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uac04-\uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc9c0\uac01 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub418 AI \uace0\uc720\uc758 \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ucc29\uc2dc \ube44\uad50\ub294 \uc815\ub82c\u00b7\ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\u00b7\uc548\uc804\uc131 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents\nFedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs\nwithout accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a\nsimilarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the\nfull LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model\nperformance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment\n(ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM\nduring FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized\nsub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local\nresource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source\nLLMs across a variety of downstream tasks.

In\nthis work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that\nincorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident\nresponse simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game\nenvironment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and\nincorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce\ntwo retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation\n(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We\nevaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced\nargumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To\nvalidate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based\non public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct\ncomplex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation\nimproves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational\nmodels.

Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs\nsystematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,\npotentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has\nexamined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to\ncontact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary.

We challenge both fundamental\nassumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel\napproach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the\nconventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text\nspace, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation\nspace and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through\nselective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic\nintegration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive\nimage-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves\nnotable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,\nVizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing\nexpected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text\nassociations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results\nprovide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not\nnecessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning\ntasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces\ncomputational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about\nmodality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal\narchitectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

Using six years of hourly data\ncollected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro,\nthermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both\nindividual energy outputs and total production (\\cyr{including imports, which\nclosely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input\nMulti-Output ($\\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and\nseasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are\nincorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\\mathtt{ELM}$\nmodel significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for\nsolar and thermal energy, achieving an $\\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\\%$ and\n$5.1\\%$, respectively, with $\\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon).

Our approach integrates transfer learning and\nextensive data augmentation, where CNNs extract local spatial features,\nTransformers model global dependencies, and CKAN facilitates nonlinear feature\nfusion for improved representation learning. To assess generalization, we\nevaluate our models on multiple benchmark datasets (HAM10000,BCN20000 and\nPAD-UFES) under varying data distributions and class imbalances. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures effectively\ncapture both spatial and contextual features, leading to improved\nclassification performance. Additionally, the integration of CKAN enhances\nfeature fusion through learnable activation functions, yielding more\ndiscriminative representations.

This\nnecessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational\nefficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive\nauto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting\nmodels struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and\nhave difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,\nhigh-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online\nensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale\npredictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of\nmultiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,\nthus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes\nthis with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean\noperational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on\nreal-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.\nIn online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an\naverage of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a\npredictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system.

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise.

Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to\n95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination\ncomplicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus\nphotographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical\nsettings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to\nlearn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a\nResponsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles\nacross the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for\npreprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification\nmodels. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local\ndataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated\nsignificant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by\n6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as\nDisparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable\nperformance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to\nreduce healthcare disparities.

This version is a pre-MIT Press publication\n  version", "summary": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

These models typically combine a\nVision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM)\nfor text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning\nmethod to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates\nto their weights.

Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot\nArena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy,\ncalibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bridge\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 LLM \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 LLM \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud574 LLM \ud3c9\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\ub78c-LLM \uac04 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790(\u2018LLM-as-a-judge\u2019)\ub85c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc790\ub3d9\ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c LLM \ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \uc0ac\ub78c \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc774 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\u00b7\ud574\uc11d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9(\uc608: \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud2b9\uc131, \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130)\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc808\ub300 \uc810\uc218 \ubc0f \uc30d\ube44\uad50(two-choice) \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ucd94\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc810\uadfc\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "6\uac1c LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc640 \ub450 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(BigGen Bench, Chatbot Arena)\uc5d0\uc11c Bridge\ub85c \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c LLM \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uc810\uacfc\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub3c4(\uc815\ud655\ub3c4), \uad50\uc815(calibration), KL \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc0ac\ub78c-LLM \uac04\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Bridge\ub294 LLM \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc778\uac04 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Subject-specific ER can benefit\nsignificantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each\ndomain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and\nrobustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often\noverlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting\nsubject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific\ncharacteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a\nmulti-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on\nco-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities\nand multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo\nparticularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,\nsuch as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level\nnuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and\ngenerates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,\nin conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target\nsamples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only\nconfident target features are combined.

However,\ndirectly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is\nchallenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap\nbetween natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature\nAlignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo\ncolorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct\nprocessing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our\nprimary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two\nimages, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We\nachieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust\nto different metric choices.

However, it remains largely\nunderexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering\ntechniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied\nindependently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the\ndesired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe\nanswer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal\nactivity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert\nwhen asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained\nsteering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using\ncontrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts\nrequired for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to\ntrain a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.\nOur approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces\nhallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static\nbaselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "L2S\ub294 \uc785\ub825\ubcc4(input-specific) \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\ud504\ud2b8(steering vector)\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc758 \ud589\uc704\ub97c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc18c\ud615 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \uc785\ub825\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ub418\uc5b4, \uc815\uc801(\ud3c9\uade0) \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud658\uac01(hallucination) \uac10\uc18c\uc640 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0(\ud639\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c) \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub300\uc751(\uc608: \ubd88\ubc95 \ud589\uc704 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud68c\ud53c, \uc758\ub8cc\uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uad8c\uace0 \ub4f1)\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc785\ub825 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uac15\uc81c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "\uc785\ub825-\ud2b9\ud654(prompt-based) \ub300\uc870\uc801(contrastive) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub85c \uc774\uc0c1\uc801 \uc785\ub825\ubcc4 \uc2dc\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub418, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ud574\ub2f9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc18c\ud615 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc785\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uac8c \ud568(Learn-to-Stein, L2S). \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ubca1\ud130\ub85c MLLM\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc120\ud615 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uac00\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad50\uc815.", "result": "\uc815\uc801 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 hallucination\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804 \uaddc\uc57d\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc900\uc218\ud568.

This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense\nRepresentation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model\nfor skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a\nTransformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature\nDecorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The\nDSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial\nstructure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature\ndecorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce\ndimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module\nemploys both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.\nThe former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the\nimpact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the\nlearning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments\non 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,\ncovering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction.

While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for\nmultimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information\ndynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal\nChain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a\njoint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning\nstate is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and\naligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective\ncognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language\nmodel`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,\nand MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on\nbenchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently\nimproves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong\nbaselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and\nopen-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a\npromising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a\nscalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference.

Therefore, automating the design of SpTA\naccelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either\nmapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or\nsparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to\nsuboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A\nunified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,\nintegrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in\nthe design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \\times\n64} \\times Q_{64 \\times 48} = Z_{32 \\times 48}$). This vast search space\nrenders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm\noptimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor\naccelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a\nmore comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and\nsparse strategy.

As a fundamental\nprinciple, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains\n(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously\nencountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite\nsignificant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still\nchallenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on\ndeep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect\nshallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,\nleading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge\nof previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting\nhistorical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an\nappropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA\nprocess.

In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first\nframework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of\nindividuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a\ncoarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust\ncrowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and\nsevere occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based\nhuman motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The\ncore of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term\ndynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals\nwith similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous\nMotion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion\nsegments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and\nplausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization\nand rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no\nexisting well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual\nbenchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction\nfrom large-scene videos.

However, enabling deep learning models to\naccurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task.\nDe-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB\nappearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically\ntargeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our\napproach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB\ncompletion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to\nprovide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with\noccluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions.\nThe reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the\nsecond stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To\nfurther enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features\nderived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP\nencoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder\nfine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a\nknown limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent\nspace transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances\neven under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in\nboth mask and RGB completion.

Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning\nis naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process\ntends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal\nthat samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,\nthereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This\nmotivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)\nproblem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning\n(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,\nwhich acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased\nevidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness\nconstraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence\nallocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment\nmechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the\nintegration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence.

This urgency is reflected in\nemerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent\nbias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness\ntesting remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and\nprivacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess\ngroup disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in\ngaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is\noften split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions\nwith predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data\ncontaining protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal\ninformation. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to\nestimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose\nutilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint\ndistributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics.

Therefore, we propose two\ncomponents that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability\nand the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup.

Levine", "Matthew Berger"], "title": "Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates", "comment": null, "summary": "Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to\ntraditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nhave enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the\nrise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven\nnews diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show\nthat this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level\nmisperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal\nreasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades\nthe quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts\nsignificantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To\nsystematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale\nbenchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of\ndiversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth\nverification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial\nevidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning\nconsistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art\nLVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and\nincreasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under\nadversarial evidence injection.

However, in sparse-view scenarios,\ndespite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests\nappearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance\nartifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current\napproaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to\naggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real\nappearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance\nartifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed\nCo-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,\ni.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple\nrenderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.\nThe analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated\nas the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose\ntwo lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in\nsparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise\ninjection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and\ntheir effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks.

To address this, we propose a\nFrequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates\nfrequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in\nkernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency\ndomain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction\n(DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while\nmaintaining stability.

Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects\nof human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next\nlocation visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility\npatterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an\nunderexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best\npractices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast\nan individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this\nexperiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse\nmodels, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an\nin-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility\npatterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and\nTransformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating\nindividual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We\nshow that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and\nuser-specific historical information can help the model better understand\nindividual patterns of life and improve predictions.

How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore\nthe similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging\nissues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image\nsets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.\nExisting deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively\nadjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited\nperformance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines\ntraditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC\napproach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)\nnetwork to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature\nrepresentations of each image set and the distance similarities between\ndifferent sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep\nfeature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The\ndeep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn\n(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is\nexploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each\nimage set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by\ndeveloping a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function.

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for\ninvestigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.\nCode: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Unlike general\nrestoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage\nabundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the\ntransformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly\nfrom that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform\ncorrection strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local\ncontextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To\nthis end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion\nand dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on\ntransformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale\nFusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing\noriginal features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary\nartifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via\nhorizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy,\nwhich improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uadf8\ub9bc\uc790 \uc81c\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud574 'Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block'\uacfc 'Dual-Path Mamba Group'\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c Mamba \uae30\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc800\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc640 \uc6d0\ubcf8\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc735\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uacc4 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc218\ud3c9 \uc2a4\uce94\uacfc \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc778\uc2dd \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc2a4\uce94\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc5ed \ubb38\ub9e5\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\uc5ec SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub9bc\uc790 \uc81c\uac70\ub294 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ube44\uadf8\ub9bc\uc790 \uc601\uc5ed\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \uadf8\ub9bc\uc790\uc640 \ube44\uadf8\ub9bc\uc790\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \ube44\uad6d\uc18c \ubb38\ub9e5 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Mamba \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc124\uacc4: (1) Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB): \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \uc800\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub97c \uc644\ud654.

This work presents CLAIRE-DSA, a deep learning--based framework\ndesigned to categorize key image properties in minimum intensity projections\n(MinIPs) acquired during MT for AIS, supporting downstream quality control and\nworkflow optimization. CLAIRE-DSA uses pre-trained ResNet backbone models,\nfine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast,\nprojection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained\non an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model\nachieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$\nto $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of\nCLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by\nfiltering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on\nfiltered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from\n$42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$.

These views share a single ground truth (GT),\nforming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders\nadvanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as\nthey are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image\nis independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error\naccumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.\nTo address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented\nperspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency\nAugmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent\nconsistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented\nbaseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,\nwe introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency\nrepresentation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module\n(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware\nview through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module\n(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information\ninteraction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe\nmaterials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation\nmodel, we achieve a 70.6\\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2\ngroup-annotated data (5\\textperthousand).

To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed\nat enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex\nurban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the\ndetection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism.\nThe Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of\ntrajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism.\nThe Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors\nto provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly\nimproving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.\nFurthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical\ntrajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks,\neffectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the\nUAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant\nimprovements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators,\nhighlight its superior robustness and adaptability.

However, several key issues remain. For example, existing\nmethods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in\nthe number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle\ncontent and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging\nmultiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent\ncontent leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both\nimage prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the\ndenoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can\nintervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the\ndenoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill\na small representative set of attention features from the large number of\nattention values extracted from the style samples.

However, through an\nempirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we\nobserve a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the\nground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions\noften leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this\nissue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions\ncan be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on\nthis insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic\nblock-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,\neffectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and\ntoward high-quality outputs.

However, many prevalent\nworks focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature\nextraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a\nmulti-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to\neffectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic\ninformation. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space\nvia a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the\nrepresentation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral\ncross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and\npseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an\nencoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR\npoints. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to\nmitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D\nconvolution processes.

A\ncritical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual\nprompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although\nrecent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,\nand no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability\nto evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using\nlayout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and\ndegrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to\nassess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image\ngeneration.

It can develop generalized representations or\nmore balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term\nknowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging\nincremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have\nachieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the\ngeneralization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it\nhelps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and\nrobustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual\nmethods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their\neffectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform\neven worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical\nsamples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a\ntwo-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on\nsequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,\nSEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized\nrepresentations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and\nbalance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation\n(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more\ngeneralized encoder.

During translation, it is essential to\npreserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate\nconsistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,\nan end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video\ngenerative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the\ncontrol of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified\npaired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we\nconstruct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic\nvideos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the\ncommunity, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in\ndiverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting\nsimulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the\naforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively\nunleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in\nsynthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.\nTo implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple\nthe learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a\ncomprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from\nthe perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into\ncinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground\npreservation.

In\nself-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based\nreconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the\nskeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.\nHowever, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion\npatterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.\nTo address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking\nmethod for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel\nframework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of\njoints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal\norgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore\nmore discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order\nmotion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order\nmotion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion\nacceleration are used together as the reconstruction target.

While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via\nsemantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often\nsuffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic\ndifferences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive\nReinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended\nmedical VQA.

We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and\nfixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal\nredundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion\ntransformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit\nstructured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads\ndynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,\ncross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods\neither impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a\nhardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive\ntiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via\ndynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity\nlevels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search\nalgorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention\npathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on\nsingle-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with\nfull-attention baselines.

The existing proxies often rely on\nlabelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.\nFurthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the\nconvergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the\nnetwork architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how\nchannel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a\nneural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and\nexpressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the\nrequirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage\nthe Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and\nthe extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a\nresult, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the\nlogarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature\ncondition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output.

This\npaper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object\ntracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,\nMMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,\nmodality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.\nAccordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,\nlaying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a\ndiscussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and\nannotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on\ndifferent ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the\nauxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental\nconfigurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth\n(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part\nof the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an\nomni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),\ncovering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we\ndiscuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always\nguaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of\ninformation fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is\nbeneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the\ndistributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,\nrevealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal\ncategories when compared with RGB datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RGB\uc640 T/D/E/NIR/L/S \ub4f1 \uc774\uc885 \ubaa8\ub2ec\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uac01 \uac1d\uccb4 \ucd94\uc801(MMVOT)\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\u00b7\uc815\ub82c\u00b7\uc8fc\uc11d, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4, \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 4\uac00\uc9c0 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\u00b7\uace0\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec(\uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac\u00b7\ub3d9\ubb3c \ubc94\uc8fc \ubd80\uc871)\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc2dc\ud2f0 \ub4f1 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\uc801\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 MMVOT \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\ub300\ub418\uc5c8\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801.", "method": "\uad00\ub828 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0(RGB, \uc5f4(T), \uae4a\uc774(D), \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8(E), \uadfc\uc801\uc678\uc120(NIR), \uc5b8\uc5b4(L), \uc18c\ub098(S))\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\u00b7\uc815\ub82c\u00b7\uc8fc\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud55c \ub4a4, RGB\uc640 \ubcf4\uc870 X \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uacb0\ud569(\ubcf5\uc81c/\ube44\ubcf5\uc81c \uad6c\uc131 \ub4f1)\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ubd84\ub958. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\u00b7\ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d.", "result": "6\uac1c MMVOT \uacfc\uc81c\uc640 338\uac1c \ucc38\uace0\ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \uc11c\ubca0\uc774\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uac1d\uccb4 \ubc94\uc8fc\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 RGB \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub3d9\ubb3c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uac00 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc735\ud569\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud488\uc9c8\u00b7\uc815\ub82c\u00b7\uc8fc\uc11d\u00b7\ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uc801\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ud655\ubcf4, \uc815\ub82c\u00b7\uc8fc\uc11d \ud45c\uc900\ud654, \uc131\ub2a5 \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\ub860."}}

However, existing interactive world models depend on\nbidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting\nreal-time performance.

To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an\ninteractive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step\nauto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)\nA scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to\neffectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with\ndiverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables\nframe-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step\ndistillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video\ngeneration.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint\negocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key\nchallenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated\nvideo must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;\n2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the\nobserved visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these\nchallenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built\non the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a\nhead-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head\njoint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that\nexplicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within\nattention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale\nreal-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel\nmetrics to assess video-motion consistency.

We propose HierAdaptMR, a\nhierarchical feature adaptation framework that addresses multi-level domain\nvariations through parameter-efficient adapters. Our method employs\nProtocol-Level Adapters for sequence-specific characteristics and Center-Level\nAdapters for scanner-dependent variations, built upon a variational unrolling\nbackbone. A Universal Adapter enables generalization to entirely unseen centers\nthrough stochastic training that learns center-invariant adaptations. The\nframework utilizes multi-scale SSIM loss with frequency domain enhancement and\ncontrast-adaptive weighting for robust optimization. Comprehensive evaluation\non the CMRxRecon2025 dataset spanning 5+ centers, 10+ scanners, and 9\nmodalities demonstrates superior cross-center generalization while maintaining\nreconstruction quality. code: https://github.com/Ruru-Xu/HierAdaptMR", "AI": {"tldr": "HierAdaptMR\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c-\ub808\ubca8 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc640 \uc13c\ud130-\ub808\ubca8 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc13c\ud130 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub2c8\ubc84\uc124 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub97c \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc5b8\ub864\ub9c1 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc704\uc5d0 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \ubcd1\uc6d0\u00b7\uc2a4\uce90\ub108 \uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uc7a5 MRI \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c SSIM\uacfc \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac15\uc870, \ucf58\ud2b8\ub77c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, CMRxRecon2025 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4-\uc13c\ud130 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2ec\uc7a5 MRI \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcd1\uc6d0\ubcc4 \uc2a4\uce90\ub108\u00b7\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ucc28\uc774(\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc2dc\ud504\ud2b8)\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc13c\ud130 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \uc2ec\ud568. \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc13c\ud130\u00b7\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\ubcc0\ubd84 \uc5b8\ub864\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0bd\uc785: \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c-\ub808\ubca8 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130(\uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ud2b9\uc774\uc131), \uc13c\ud130-\ub808\ubca8 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130(\uc2a4\uce90\ub108 \ud2b9\uc774\uc131), \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc13c\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc720\ub2c8\ubc84\uc124 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130. \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c SSIM\uacfc \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac15\ud654, \ucf58\ud2b8\ub77c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "CMRxRecon2025(5+ \uc13c\ud130, 10+ \uc2a4\uce90\ub108, 9 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4-\uc13c\ud130 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc6b0\uc218. \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0.", "conclusion": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uc720\ub2c8\ubc84\uc124 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc13c\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c MRI \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131. \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ud575\uc2ec."}}

Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for\ndemanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting\nhumans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has\nreceived much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and\ndense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed\nby human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding\nof the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to\nguide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect\nview-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated\nvisualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of\na scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image\ncoverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we\nleverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a\nvision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked\nobjects to guide the user during scanning.

A primary challenge arises from ambiguity\nintroduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing\ncorresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as\nocclusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit\nphotometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that\nutilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along\nthe epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we\nfinetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:\nleft-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the\nright camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right\ncameras.

Action-driven video generation\nfaces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive\nactions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while\nagent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain\ntransferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we\npropose to \"render\" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic\nrepresentations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain\nadaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for\ntheir generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct\nskeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions\n(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of\naction-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into\npretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable\nprecise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of\ncross-domain dynamics.

While many techniques have\nadvanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse\ntopologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent\ntopological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts\nthe establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,\nthe current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different\ntopological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven\napproaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,\ntraining-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only\none or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set\nof bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that\nMotion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both\nsimilar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical\nutility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in\ndownstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for\nindustrial applications.

Multiview observations from a\nsingle scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing\napproaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,\nbackground completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,\nboth of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a\nnovel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing\nobservations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between\ncaptures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation\naware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic\nconsistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a\npseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative\nco-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity\nrendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or\ncomplex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong\ngeneralization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness\nfor real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer.
