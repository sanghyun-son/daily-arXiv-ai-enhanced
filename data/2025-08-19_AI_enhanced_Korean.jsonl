By representing AI agents as coupled oscillators with both phase and\namplitude dynamics, our model captures essential aspects of agent\nspecialization, influence, and communication within networked systems. We\nintroduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and\nsynchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent\ndiversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior.\nFurthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought\nprompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like\niterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive\nsimulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate\nthat increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous\nagent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios.

Recent methods apply heuristics based\non positive document scores to identify hard negatives, improving both\nperformance and interpretability. However, these global, example agnostic\nstrategies often miss instance specific false negatives. To address this, we\npropose a learnable adapter module that monitors Bi-Encoder representations to\nestimate the likelihood that a hard negative is actually a false negative. This\nprobability is modeled dynamically and contextually, enabling fine-grained,\nquery specific judgments. The predicted scores are used in two downstream\ncomponents: (1) resampling, where negatives are reweighted during training, and\n(2) reranking, where top-k retrieved documents are reordered at inference.\nEmpirical results on standard benchmarks show that our adapter-enhanced\nframework consistently outperforms strong Bi-Encoder baselines, underscoring\nthe benefit of explicit false negative modeling in dense retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud559\uc2b5 \uc911 \ud558\ub4dc \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uc815\ub2f5(\uac70\uc9d3 \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c)\uc77c \ud655\ub960\uc744 Bi-Encoder \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud574, \uc7ac\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc7ac\ub7ad\ud0b9\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc784.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc740 \uc608\uc2dc\ubcc4(\ucffc\ub9ac\ubcc4) \uac70\uc9d3 \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \ub193\uce58\uae30 \uc27d\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc00\uc9d1 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc190\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "Bi-Encoder \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub85c \uac01 \ud558\ub4dc \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c\uac00 \uac70\uc9d3 \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c\uc77c \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\u00b7\ubb38\ub9e5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc740 (1) \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c \uc7ac\uac00\uc911(\uc7ac\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1)\uacfc (2) \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc0c1\uc704 k \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc7ac\ub7ad\ud0b9\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c Bi-Encoder \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uac70\uc9d3 \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\ucffc\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc774\uc801 \uac70\uc9d3 \ub124\uac70\ud2f0\ube0c \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba74 \ubc00\uc9d1 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation.

We show that BMQExpander\nhas superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information\nRetrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with\nimprovements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5%\nover the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under\nquery perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up\nto 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we\npublish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows\nthat BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query\nexpansion baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "BMQExpander\ub294 UMLS \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc2dd(\uc815\uc758\u00b7\uad00\uacc4)\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc778\uc2dd \uc9c8\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0dd\uc758\ud559 \ubb38\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c NDCG@10 \ub4f1 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0(\ucd5c\ub300 +22.1% vs sparse), \ucffc\ub9ac \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uba70(\ucd5c\ub300 +15.7% vs \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778), \ud658\uac01(hallucination)\ub3c4 \uc801\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc758\ud559 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uc6a9\uc5b4\uc640 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 sparse/dense/\ud655\uc7a5 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc758\ud559 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc9c8\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc77c\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "UMLS \uba54\ud0c0\uc2dc\uc18c\ub7ec\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ub150 \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c LLM\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778(BMQExpander)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778(\ud76c\uc18c\u00b7\ubc00\uc9d1 \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc84, \uae30\uc874 \uc9c8\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc29\uc2dd, \uc0dd\uc758\ud559 \ud2b9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, NFCorpus/TREC-COVID/SciFact \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00. \ucffc\ub9ac \ubcc0\ud615(perturbation) \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uc815\uc131\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d(\ud658\uac01 \uc5ec\ubd80)\ub3c4 \uc218\ud589.", "result": "\uc138 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud76c\uc18c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778 \ub300\ube44 NDCG@10 \ucd5c\ub300 +22.1%, \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 +6.5% \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uace0. \ucffc\ub9ac \ubcc0\ud615 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\ub3c5\ud559\uc2b5 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ub300 +15.7% \uac1c\uc120. \ud328\ub7ec\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacf5\uac1c \ubc0f \uc815\uc131\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud655\uc7a5\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud658\uac01\uc774 \uc801\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd(\uc815\uc758\u00b7\uad00\uacc4)\uc744 LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc9c8\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uc0dd\uc758\ud559 \ubb38\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc8fc\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131(\ud658\uac01 \uac10\uc18c) \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4."}}

Numerous deep\nlearning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively\nacquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and\nphotoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model\nperformance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The\nstudy introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning\nscheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a\ncomputational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully\nachieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds\nfor a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a\nlarge-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data\nsegments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and\n31-234 mmHg for DBP).

In ophthalmology,\nseveral FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to\nfundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across\ndifferent tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is\nthe first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic\nFMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive\nevaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different\nophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection\n(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and\nsystemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal\nimaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,\nRetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and\nevaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that\nDINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and\nsystemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on\nexternal datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach\nprovides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.\nDespite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension\nin external cohort remains challenging.

Here, we present LARC, the first LLM-based Agentic framework for\nRetrosynthesis planning under Constraints. LARC incorporates agentic constraint\nevaluation, through an Agent-as-a-Judge, directly into the retrosynthesis\nplanning process, using agentic feedback grounded in tool-based reasoning to\nguide and constrain route generation.

Recent\nadvancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing\nrecommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in\noptimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive\ngeneration mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential\ndependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable\nfor generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single\nrequest session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a\nframework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance\ngenerative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework\nreformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,\nwhere each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,\nand then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative\ntask in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline\nintegrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial\nincremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and\nemphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our\nextensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale\nindustrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend.

The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve\npreviously learned knowledge during incremental updates?

Our approach builds upon a large vision-language\nmodel (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting\nnew LoRA modules for each modality or task.

Between a literature\ndigest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical\napplication potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science\nstudies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate\nLLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the\nassessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding\na specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable\narbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs\nwith questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a\nsolid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We\nexemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the\nprompts.

While most existing\nstudies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to\nvariations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,\nwe propose \\textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation\nframework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.\nWe hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave\nat varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning\nthrough a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.\nExperiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across\ndiverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization\ncapability.

It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot\ncoordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent\ndecentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,\nespecially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these\nagents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental\ntemporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance\ndegradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for\nMAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding\ndecisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational\nawareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial\nfeatures and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions\nprediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more\ninformed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex\nmulti-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an\nautomatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical\nmap layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,\nshowcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.\nNotably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAPF-World\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\u00b7\ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0(action world) \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 MAPF \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ubc84\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uba3c \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c0\ud615\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub9f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc194\ubc84\ub294 \ubc18\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uba38\ubb3c\ub7ec \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 action world \ubaa8\ub378(MAPF-World)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud574 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ud574 \ub354 \uba3c \uc2dc\uc810\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub9f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc744 \ud604\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud559\uc2b5\ud615 \uc194\ubc84\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc14\uae65(\uc678\uc0bd) \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud588\ub2e4. \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uac8c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\ub294 96.5% \uc791\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub3c4 92% \uc801\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 MAPF-World\ub294 \ub354 \uba3c \uc2dc\uc810\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\ubaa8\ub378 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\ub9ac\ud558\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub85c\ubd07\u00b7\ubb3c\ub958\u00b7\uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \ud06c\ub2e4."}}

Existing GDA systems, however,\nmeasure WAN BW statically and independently between data centers (DCs), while\ndata transfer occurs dynamically and simultaneously among DCs during workload\nexecution. Also, they use a single connection WAN BW that cannot capture actual\nWAN capacities between distant DCs. Such inaccurate WAN BWs yield sub-optimal\ndecisions, inflating overall query latency and cost. In this paper, we present\nWANify, a new framework that precisely and dynamically gauges achievable\nruntime WAN BW using a machine learning prediction scheme, decision tree-based\nRandom Forest. This helps GDA systems make better decisions yielding reduced\nlatency and costs including WAN BW monitoring costs. Based on predicted runtime\nWAN BW, WANify determines the optimal number of heterogeneous parallel\nconnections for data transfer among DCs. This approach improves performance\nwithout additional, or even at reduced cost, by fully exploiting available WAN\ncapacities.

Sobel"], "title": "Congested Clique Counting for Local Gibbs Distributions", "comment": null, "summary": "There are well established reductions between combinatorial sampling and\ncounting problems (Jerrum, Valiant, Vazirani TCS 1986). Building off of a very\nrecent parallel algorithm utilizing this connection (Liu, Yin, Zhang arxiv\n2024), we demonstrate the first approximate counting algorithm in the\nCongestedClique for a wide range of problems. Most interestingly, we present an\nalgorithm for approximating the number of $q$-colorings of a graph within\n$\\epsilon$-multiplicative error, when $q>\\alpha\\Delta$ for any constant\n$\\alpha>2$, in $\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ rounds. More\ngenerally, we achieve a runtime of\n$\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ rounds for approximating the\npartition function of Gibbs distributions defined over graphs when simple\nlocality and fast mixing conditions hold. Gibbs distributions are widely used\nin fields such as machine learning and statistical physics. We obtain our\nresult by providing an algorithm to draw $n$ random samples from a distributed\nMarkov chain in parallel, using similar ideas to triangle counting (Dolev,\nLenzen, Peled DISC 2012) and semiring matrix multiplication (Censor-Hillel,\nKaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela PODC 2015). Aside from counting problems,\nthis result may be interesting for other applications requiring a large number\nof samples. In the special case of estimating the partition function of the\nhardcore model, also known as counting weighted independent sets, we can do\neven better and achieve an $\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ round\nalgorithm, when the fugacity $\\lambda \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta-1}$, where\n$\\alpha$ is an arbitrary constant less than $1$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1-\uacc4\uc218(reduction)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 CongestedClique \ubd84\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac \uacc4\uc218(approximate counting) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ub4e4\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 q-\uc0c9\uce60 \uac1c\uc218\ub97c \u03b5-\uc624\ucc28(\uacf1\uc148)\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 q>\u03b1\u0394 (\uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc0c1\uc218 \u03b1>2)\uc77c \ub54c \u00d5(n^{1/3}/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6d\uc18c\uc131(locality)\uacfc \ube60\ub978 \ud63c\ud569(fast mixing)\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 Gibbs \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubd84\ud560\ud568\uc218(partition function)\ub3c4 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\uac00\uc911 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc9d1\ud569)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \u03bb \u2264 \u03b1/(\u0394\u22121), \u03b1<1 \uc77c \ub54c \u00d5(1/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub85c \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc2e4\ud589\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c n\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0bc\uac01\ud615 \uacc4\uc0b0\uacfc \uc138\ubbf8\ub9c1 \ud589\ub82c\uacf1 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ucc28\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uacc4\uc218 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ud658\uc6d0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc73c\ub098(\uace0\uc804\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub4e4), \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud2b9\ud788 CongestedClique \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uadfc\uc0ac \uacc4\uc218 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub098 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c Gibbs \ubd84\ud3ec\ub098 \uc0c9\uce60/\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc9d1\ud569 \uac19\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd84\ud560\ud568\uc218\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(like Liu, Yin, Zhang)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\u21c4\uacc4\uc218 \ud658\uc6d0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218(\u0398(n))\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0-\ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc0bc\uac01\ud615 \uc218/\uc138\ubbf8\ub9c1 \ud589\ub82c\uacf1 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ud574 CongestedClique\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uad6d\uc18c\uc131 \ubc0f \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ud63c\ud569 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "q>\u03b1\u0394(\u03b1>2)\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 q-\uc0c9\uce60 \uac1c\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \u00d5(n^{1/3}/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 Gibbs \ubd84\ud3ec(\uad6d\uc18c\uc131+\ube60\ub978 \ud63c\ud569)\ub3c4 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5. \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \u03bb \u2264 \u03b1/(\u0394\u22121)(\u03b1<1)\uc77c \ub54c \u00d5(1/\u03b5^2) \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub85c \ub354 \ube60\ub984. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ub7c9 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc0b0 CongestedClique \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\ud569\ub860\uc801/\ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uacc4\uc218 \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \uadfc\uc0ac \uacc4\uc218 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0c9\uce60\uacfc \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04-\uc808\uc57d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ubc94\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc751\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4."}}

While recent advances in\nTime Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation\nthrough large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a\nunimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and\ntextual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world\nscenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal\nframework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,\nand text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance.

In contrast, (social) allostasis\nproposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations\nto reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental\ndemands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This\npaper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic\nregulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,\nanalogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from\nboth the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic\nreconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across\nseveral dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that\nallostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage\nenvironmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to\nimproved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents.

Rethinking Augmentation in Multimodal Hate Detection", "comment": "13 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the\nchallenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed\nthrough subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or\nsatire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,\nthese models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible\nto implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to\nimprove multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization\nframework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,\nand training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both\ninfluence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in\nsmall models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and\nscaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline\nthat generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting\nthe hateful modality.

However,\nexisting LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static\nand single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete\nuser profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round\nrecommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided\nDynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile\nthrough a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation\nfidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each\noptimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module,\ncalibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific\ndefects in the user profile.

However, UFL faces several challenges\nin practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed\n(non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and\ncommunication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise.\nPrevious UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which\nintroduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this\npaper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional\nComputing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight\ntraining and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to\ncommunication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve\nUFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal\nmethod addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On\nthe server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data\ndistribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves\nup to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in\ntraining, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on\naverage across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various\ntypes of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedUHD\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ub514\uba58\uc154\ub110 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(HDC)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5(UFL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5f0\uc0b0\u00b7\ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub0b4\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 NN \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21\uc758 kNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubca1\ud130 \uc81c\uac70\uc640 \uc11c\ubc84 \uce21\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 HDC \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \ube44IID \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "UFL\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, (1) \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \uac04 \ube44IID \ub370\uc774\ud130, (2) \uc5d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc5f0\uc0b0\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9, (3) \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc5d0\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ub4f1 \uc2e4\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 NN\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc744 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "FedUHD\ub294 HDC \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 kNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubca1\ud130 \uc81c\uac70\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub0b4 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 HDC \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04 \ube44IID\ub97c \ubcf4\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uacfc \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc9c0\ud5a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c FedUHD\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 173.6\u00d7, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 612.7\u00d7 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 271\u00d7 \uac10\uc18c\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \uae30\uc874 NN \uae30\ubc18 UFL \ub300\ube44 15.50% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc7a1\uc74c \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub85c\ubc84\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HDC\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, FedUHD\ub294 \ube44IID\u00b7\ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc81c\ud55c\u00b7\ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc7a1\uc74c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc9c0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c UFL\uc744 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4."}}

Through\nsystematic analysis of real-world industrial data, we uncover two critical\nchallenges in watch time prediction from a distribution aspect: (1)\ncoarse-grained skewness induced by a significant concentration of quick-skips1,\n(2) fine-grained diversity arising from various user-video interaction\npatterns. Consequently, we assume that the watch time follows the\nExponential-Gaussian Mixture (EGM) distribution, where the exponential and\nGaussian components respectively characterize the skewness and diversity.\nAccordingly, an Exponential-Gaussian Mixture Network (EGMN) is proposed for the\nparameterization of EGM distribution, which consists of two key modules: a\nhidden representation encoder and a mixture parameter generator. We conducted\nextensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on the\nindustrial short-video feeding scenario of Xiaohongshu App to validate the\nsuperiority of EGMN compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.\nRemarkably, comprehensive experimental results have proven that EGMN exhibits\nexcellent distribution fitting ability across coarse-to-fine-grained levels.

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived\ngraph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or\nanomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting\nfeatures from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness\nof the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for\nGNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we\nsystematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge\nconstruction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and\nshape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to\nperform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on\ndermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance\nand efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised\nregimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute\nthe best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features\nconsistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised\nconfiguration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805\nwithout relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.\nWith the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to\n0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95(\ubd84\ud560, \uac04\uc120 \uad6c\uc131, \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131)\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc218\uc900 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \ud0d0\uc9c0(GLAD)\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c9\uc0c1, \uc9c8\uac10, \ud615\ud0dc \ud2b9\uc131 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 OCGTL\uc5d0\uc11c AUC-ROC 0.805, \uc57d\uac04\uc758 \ub77c\ubca8 \ud3ec\ud568 \uc2dc 0.872, \uc644\uc804 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc2dc 0.914\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, GLAD\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubd84\ud560 \ubc29\uc2dd, \uac04\uc120 \uad6c\uc131, \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131 \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 GLAD \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub824 \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud53c\ubd80 \ud53c\ubd80 \uc601\uc0c1(dermoscopic images)\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\ud560 \uc2a4\ud0b4(\uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc2dd), \uac04\uc120 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5, \uc0c9\uc0c1\u00b7\uc9c8\uac10\u00b7\ud615\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc870\ud569\ud574 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc720\ub798 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 GLAD \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4(\uc608: OCGTL \ub4f1)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc21c\uc218 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4\u00b7\uc57d\uc9c0\ub3c4\u00b7\uc644\uc804\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud568.", "result": "\uc0c9\uc0c1 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ud615\ud0dc\uc640 \uc9c8\uac10 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uba74 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428. \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 OCGTL \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c AUC-ROC 0.805, \uc77c\ubd80 \ub77c\ubca8 \ud3ec\ud568 \uc2dc 0.872, \uc804\uccb4 \ub77c\ubca8 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc 0.914\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131. \ub610\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubc31\ubcf8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\u2192\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc124\uacc4(\ubd84\ud560\u00b7\uac04\uc120\u00b7\ud2b9\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd)\uac00 GLAD \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \uc0c9\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub418 \ud615\ud0dc\u00b7\uc9c8\uac10\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac1c\uc120\ud568. \uc801\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c \uc57d\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc784."}}

Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically\nutilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in\ncontinuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation\nsystems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from\nthe continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt\npersonalized information within latent representations. In this work, we\npropose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation\nModel (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an\nasymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the\nmissing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is\nthen performed in an asymmetric latent feature space.

Standard\nFederated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to\nmodel divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase\nframework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated\ninitialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a\nfoundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent\nstarting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,\nwhere it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a\nheterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable\nregion of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a\nparallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that\nweights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine\nsimilarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the\nconverged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average\ntest accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming\npersonalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and\nmechanical fault datasets, respectively.

With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction\ntuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly\nfocus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker\ncharacteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to\ncomprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the\ncapacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker\ncharacteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among\nspeaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified\nframework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage\nin-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn\nspeaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context\ninstruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,\ndemonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template\ndesign, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context\nexamples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval\nstrategy, example ordering, and the number of examples.

In this paper, we present\nthe Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the\neffectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different\ngame-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,\nlexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog\nquality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,\nand neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws\nto characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our\nfindings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions\nand higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater\nvocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf\nand Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained\nvocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives\ninfluence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for\nmeasuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems.

We\nintegrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal\nfairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context\nlearning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance\nfairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10%\nimprovements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific\ncausal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves\nthese gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its\nefficiency in low-data regimes.

We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient\nfinetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments\nsystematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation\nsets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its\nfinetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In\nparticular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between\nfinetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream\nperformance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the\nfinetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the\nimportance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between\ndifferent downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate\ncancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less\nlabeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image\nquality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained\nmodels may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This\nhighlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions\nbetween finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in\nfinetuning data for specific downstream tasks.

We further provide an\ninformation-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard\nIVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks\nand 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20%\nof the tokens.

Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and\nlearning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how\nagents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to\nmaximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative\nmodel of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have\nbeen proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they\nall share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an\nappropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their\ndesirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past\nmotor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents\nare assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan\nfor the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and\nmust infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for\nthe future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two\nleading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an\nefference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions.

For\nproduct understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures\ndrive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one\nalignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue\nthat generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant\npotential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,\nachieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:\nthe lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the\ncommon presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a\nstandard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the\nfirst generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation\nlearning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for\ntargeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)\neffectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the\ndistraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the\nspecialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity\nof negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark\nMBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model\ndemonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the\npublic dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream\ntasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute\nprediction.

In this paper, we investigate two key\naspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally\ndesigned for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning\nstrategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that\nscanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield\npromising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of\nattention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is\nefficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid\narchitecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional\nAttention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its\neffectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses\nglobal information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict\nlocal modeling.

LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel\nBlock (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN).

The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,\nand non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a\ncross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their\ncomplementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality\nand efficiency.

Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing\nthe trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing\napproaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide\nfine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation\nprocess. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence\nestimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during\ntext generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for\nconstructing training data that effectively captures the underlying\nprobabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict\nconfidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.\nFurthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that\nleverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation\nfor the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies\nfor identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the\ngeneration process.

Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely\non scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between\nobjectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method\nthat decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable\ncomponents. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g.,\nchoosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g.,\nattention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update\nframework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the\ninterpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task\ninterference, and geometry-aligned adaptation.

However, traditional VG struggles with\nsome scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this\ngap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal\nQueries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,\nvideo segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:\nlimited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,\nwhere dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose\nOVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)\nthat retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a\ncross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant\nmodalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle\nhybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct\nQVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries.

A single OOD detector may not\nprevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an\nideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the\ninherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to\npredict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also,\nsystematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even\nimpractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a\nmeta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal\nsettings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model\nbehaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with\nminimal supervision.

We systematically\nevaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and\nDeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning\ndiverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with\nthinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish\nlogarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a\npredictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings\nidentify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)\nsuitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering\noptimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and\nhigh-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.\nNotably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from\nextended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger\nmodels, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides\ngreater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific\npatterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring\nsignificantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory\nmedicine.

However, current approaches face two key\nchallenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost,\nand dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available.\nIn this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate\nthe role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel\nby leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and\necosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from\nSentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos,\nwe minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic\nalignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is\ngrounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification\ntasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single\npixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for\nthematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale\nremote sensing applications.

We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on\nmechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across\ndiseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.\nMantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics\nspanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance\nartifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis\noutperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including\nall models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel\nepidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission\nmechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.\nCritically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health\ndecision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally,\nMantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the\nactionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.\nTogether, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for\nnext-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and\ndeployable where traditional models fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mantis\ub294 4\uc5b5 \uc77c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc9c8\ubcd1\u00b7\uc9c0\uc5ed\u00b7\uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub118\ub098\ub4e4\uba70 \uc989\uc2dc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud29c\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. 8\uc8fc \uc608\uce21\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ud574\uc11d\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uc885 \uac10\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc774\ub098 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871, \uc9c8\ubcd1\ubcc4 \ub9de\ucda4 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubc94\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc30\uce58 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4\u00b7\uc804\ud30c \uc591\uc0c1\u00b7\uc911\uc7ac\u00b7\uac10\uc2dc \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd1d 4\uc5b5 \uc77c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378(Mantis)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ud568. \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad00\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uc5ed\ud559 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub428. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc131\ub3c4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "result": "6\uac1c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 39\uac1c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud29c\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378(CDC COVID-19 Forecast Hub \ud3ec\ud568)\uc744 \uc0c1\ub300\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc804\ud30c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubcf4\ub958\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uccb4\uacc4\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud588\ub2e4. 8\uc8fc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud574 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ub450 \ubc30\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubc94\uc6a9\uc801\u00b7\ud574\uc11d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac10\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc2e0\uc18d \ub300\uc751\u00b7\uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM\nevaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text.

This\ncharacteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of\ndiscriminative features for emission state identification during data mining.\nFurthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the\nlack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the\nconstruction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we\npropose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby\nenhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the\ntransformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition\nvariations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original\nhigh-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a\nset-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the\nrelationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing\nan accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm.

Analysis and Applications", "comment": "Ph.D. Thesis", "summary": "Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose\nrepresentations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five\nyears have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and\nsupervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream\ntasks.\n  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the\nknowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis\nframework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the\nacoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a\ncomparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also\nshows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream\ntask performance.\n  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on\nspeech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to\nspoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding\nthan widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration\nof SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this\nthesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)\nand named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding\nEvaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find\nthat end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded\n(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate\nE2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on\ntask performance.\n  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,\nproviding tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the\ncommunity to make informed design choices for future model development and\nadoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\u00b7\ud559\uc2b5-free \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c SFM(\uc74c\uc131 \ud30c\uc6b4\ub354\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378)\uc758 \uce35\ubcc4 \uc74c\ud5a5\u00b7\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, SLU(\ud2b9\ud788 \uc74c\uc131 NER/NEL)\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc E2E SFM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud574 E2E\uac00 \uae30\uc874 cascaded \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778 \ub17c\ubb38\uad70.", "motivation": "SFM\uc758 \uc218\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc800\uc7a5\ub418\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c ASR\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc2ec\uce35 SLU\uc5d0 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568. \ub610\ud55c SLU \ud3c9\uac00\uc6a9 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294(statistics + training-free tasks) \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec SFM\uc758 \uce35\ubcc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ube44\uad50\u00b7\ubd84\uc11d.

However, existing methods often\nsuffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling\nand supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their\nactual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a\nmoment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated\ndataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually\nannotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the\nexpression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens\nvideo-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to\nguide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding.

Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of\nthe generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,\nthus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not\napplicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on\ninaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation\nerrors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing\nresources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we\npropose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).\nSince allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content\naccuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this\nsensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource\ntradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all\nusers with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution\nspace that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with\nlow complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the\nLP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original\nthree-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while\nimproving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to\nexisting DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F\nconverges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,\nimproving AvgCAQA by more than 14%.

Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal\ndynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural\nNetworks (51.23\\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\\% with RGB), and frame\nreconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM =\n0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input.

Conditioned on a\npatient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical\nevent, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks,\nincluding diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations.\nRemarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based\ninference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised\nmodels on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot\nexamples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and\npretraining scale. Our results show that CoMET, a generative medical event\nfoundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing\nan extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making,\nstreamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc775\uba85 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130(1510\uc5b5 \ud1a0\ud070)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38(CoMET)\uac00 \ud658\uc790 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\u00b7\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud55c\ub2e4. 78\uac1c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1\u00b7\uc6b4\uc601 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ubcc4 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\u00b7\ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\uc5f0\uc0b0\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub410\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778\ub9de\ucda4 \uc758\ub8cc\ub97c \uc2e4\ubb34 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \ud658\uc790 \uc5ec\uc815\uc744 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc694\uc57d\u00b7\uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc94\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc804\uc6d0\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uac74\uac15\uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc784\uc0c1\u00b7\uc6b4\uc601 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Epic Cosmos(3.0\uc5b5 \ud658\uc790, 163\uc5b5 \ubc29\ubb38)\uc758 \uc775\uba85\ud654\ub41c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 1.15e11 \uac1c\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8(1510\uc5b5 \ud1a0\ud070)\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1. \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc0b0-\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38(CoMET) \uacc4\uc5f4(\ucd5c\ub300 10\uc5b5 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5. \ud658\uc790 \uacfc\uac70\ub97c \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\uac00\ud68c\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589. 78\uac1c \uc2e4\uc81c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00(\uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21, \uc9c4\ud589 \uc608\uce21, \uc6b4\uc601 \uc608\uce21 \ub4f1).", "result": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 + \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ucd94\ub860 \ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ubcc4 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131. \ubaa8\ub378\u00b7\ud1a0\ud070\u00b7\uc5f0\uc0b0\ub7c9\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120(\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59) \uad00\ucc30. \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc\u2013\uc218\uc5b5 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uac70\ub300 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc2dc\uc0ac.", "conclusion": "CoMET\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ud615 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc6b4\ub370\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0\u00b7\uc758\ub8cc \uc6b4\uc601 \uac1c\uc120\u00b7\ud658\uc790 \uc608\ud6c4 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

A critical research gap lies in\nidentifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation\n-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence\nover time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal\ndata analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these\nphenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims\nto identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation\nevents. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an\n\"intervention\" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and\nseparation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the\natomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we\ncan predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the\nobserved changes in the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "VAE \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubd84\uc790 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158(MDS)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc18c\uacb0\ud569 \ud615\uc131\u00b7\ubd84\ub9ac\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0, \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc77c\uc5b4\ub0a0 \ub54c\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc55e\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud568.", "motivation": "MDS\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uac74(\uc608: \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd84\uc790 \uac04 \uc218\uc18c\uacb0\ud569)\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \uac80\ud1a0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774\ub098 \uc120\ud589 \uc0ac\uac74\uc774 \uacb0\ud569 \ud615\uc131\u00b7\ubd84\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0(\uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778)\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacf5\ubc31\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568.", "method": "\uc218\uc18c\uacb0\ud569 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c '\uac1c\uc785'\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0, \uacb0\ud569/\ubd84\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc778\uacfc\ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud568.

While recent advances have made impressive progress, most\nmethods still unify all background elements into a single representation,\nhindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some\napproaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on\npre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to\ndiscrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor\nscenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving\nscenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian\nSplatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic\ndriving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D\nfeature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the\n3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities\nand enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static\ncodebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without\nrequiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the\nbest of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance\nsegmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are\navailable at our project page.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uc2dc\ucea0 \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc7a5\uba74\uc744 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c 3D\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 InstDrive \uc81c\uc548.

However, these models are not designed\nfor streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their\narchitecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the\ntransformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is\ncareless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not\nstraightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency\nstreaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder\nto a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated\ninference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to\nyield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal.\nExperiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our\nfine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in\nmost cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our\ntraining process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for\nextracting word-level timestamps.

By deriving exact Jacobians for\nleaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes\nexplicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient\npropagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in\nparameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory\nretention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners\nthat adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal\nanalogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as\nAdam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.\nNumerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,\nsupporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting\nsystematic effects on training dynamics.

However, most automated methods estimate\nlandmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even\nsmall shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant\nmeasurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent\nsemi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining\nlandmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated\nAnatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To\nenable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in\nthis work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised\nB-mode landmark detector.

Traditional machine-learning based approaches to\nperforming this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the\nability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction\nof the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,\ntime consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose\nharnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models\n(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer\nSet Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE\nusing LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied\nfor JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural\nlanguage understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It\nexploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its\ncore program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form\nof type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training\ndata on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments\nshow that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems\nin several categories with only 10\\% of training data.

Parametric projections make it\npossible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire\nprojection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data\ninstances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with\nout-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we\npropose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy\n(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a\nfixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an\ninverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as\nbaseline projection methods.

Experimental results on\nfour popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures\ngenerated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for\nstudent modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while\nenhancing interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c CSG\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud655\uc0b0 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378(CSDPM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ud574 \uad50\uc721\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804\uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud559\uc2b5\ubc1c\ub2ec \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c KT\uc640 CD \uc131\ub2a5 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870(cognitive structure)\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uac1c\ub150 \ubc0f \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2ec\ub9ac\uacc4\ub7c9\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uac1c\ub150\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CSG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uad50\uc721\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804\uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model(CSDPM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd94\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc778\uc9c0\ubc1c\ub2ec \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uc798 \uc815\ub82c\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uad50\uc721 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, CSG\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub354 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd\ucd94\uc801(KT) \ubc0f \uc778\uc9c0\uc9c4\ub2e8(CD) \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\ub3c4 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CSG\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801\u00b7\uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc9c0\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Knowledge Graphs (KGs)\noffer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated\nreasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods\noften rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively\naggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical\ncorpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty\nof evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a\nLLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.\nLeveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we\nsimulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time\nseries. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two\nspecialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor\nAgent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via\nsampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions\nand inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally\nintegrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by\nconfidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve\nconflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational\ntriples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts\ndemonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To\nevaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question\nanswering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing\nsignificant improvements over non-augmented baselines.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance.

Based on this intuition,\nwe impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval\nand streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively\nretrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we\nfurther eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance\ndegradation.

We propose the notion of\na \"cultural gene\" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from\ntheir training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200\nprompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:\nIndividualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized\nzero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an\nEastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and\nconsistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic\nand low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx\n-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance\ntendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically\nsignificant (p < 0.001).

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI\nevaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to\nexplicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615\uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 '\uc778\uacf5 \ub3c4\ub355 \ubcf4\uc870\uc790(AMA)'\ub85c\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd5c\uc885\ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\ub355 \ucd94\ub860(\uc5f0\uc5ed\uc801\u00b7\ucd94\uc815\uc801)\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ud589 LLM \uc815\ub82c \ud3c9\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc778 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8\uc758 \uc815\ud569\uc131\ub9cc \uce21\uc815\ud574 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucca0\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub17c\uc758\ub418\ub294 AMA \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud788 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc0c1\ud669\ud310\ub2e8, \uac00\uce58 \uac04 \uade0\ud615 \uc870\uc815, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucca0\ud559\uc801 \ub17c\uc758\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c AMA\uac00 \uac16\ucdb0\uc57c \ud560 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \ud589\ud0dc\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654(\uc5f0\uc5ed\u00b7\uadc0\ub0a9\u00b7\ucd94\uc815\uc801 \ub3c4\ub355\ucd94\ub860 \ub4f1)\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud588\ub2e4. \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c \uacf5\uac1c\ud615 LLM\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\ubcc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\u00b7\ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4 \uac04 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3b8\ucc28\uac00 \ucef8\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \ucd94\uc815\uc801(abductive) \ub3c4\ub355\ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc5f0\uc5ed\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uc124\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uac00\uce58\ucda9\ub3cc \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubbf8\ud761\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucca0\ud559\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\ub355\ub2a5\ub825 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2ec\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.

This makes them particularly suitable for\nstudying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable\nsetting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,\nespecially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics\nforecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can\nlearn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics\nforecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such\ncapability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations\nusing sparse autoencoders (SAEs).

We\nexplore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1)\nwhat time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying\nsolely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first\naspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal\ndependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series\nsequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,\nCC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate\nknowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive\nmodeling of time series patterns.

These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically\nidentifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the\nmodel might confidently generate despite being incorrect.

In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable\nsignals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct\nanswers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely\nconfines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome\nthis, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating\nrubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,\nmodel-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We\nconstruct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with\nover 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.\nImplementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a\nclear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable\ngains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended\nbenchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by\n+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides\nfine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the\n\"AI-like\" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses.

While\nrecent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved\nperceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details\nsuch as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity\nand customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline\nthat addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage,\nDualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned\nflow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a\nfidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the\nwarped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this\nprocess, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling\nthe model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly\naround garment seams.

While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken\nconventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against\npatch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that\nremain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either\noverfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit\ngeneralization vulnerability. We introduce \\textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level\nquantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of\npatch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature\nDisalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing\nperceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient\nPerceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients\nacross bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge\nIoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training\nProtocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme\nacross multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over\n40\\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean\naccuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic\nand perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriQDef\ub294 QNN\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ube44\ud2b8-\ud3ed \uac04 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc0bc\uc911 \ub808\ubca8 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58(FDP), \uc785\ub825 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58(GPDP: Edge IoU + HOG Cosine), \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ube44\ud2b8 \uacf5\uc720 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574, CIFAR-10 \ubc0f ImageNet\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud328\uce58\u00b7\uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 40% \uc774\uc0c1 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uae68\ub057\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "QNN\uc740 \uc5f0\uc0b0\u00b7\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5e3\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud328\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ube44\ud2b8-\ud3ed \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc5d0 \ub180\ub78d\ub3c4\ub85d \uc798 \uc804\uc774\ub41c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ube44\ud2b8-\ud3ed \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uad50\ub780\ud574 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub0ae\ucdb0\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) Feature Disalignment Penalty(FDP): \uc911\uac04 \uacc4\uce35 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc9c0\uac01\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4\ub97c \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ud30c\uad34; (2) Gradient Perceptual Dissonance Penalty(GPDP): \uc785\ub825 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\u00b7\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(Edge IoU, HOG Cosine \uc0ac\uc6a9)\ud574 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c; (3) Joint Quantization-Aware Training: \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ub808\ubca8\uc744 \uacf5\uc720 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uba70 \uc704 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569.", "result": "CIFAR-10\uacfc ImageNet \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, TriQDef\ub294 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud328\uce58\u00b7\uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 40% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc600\uace0, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uae68\ub057\ud55c(\ube44\uacf5\uaca9) \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud328\uce58 \uc804\uc774\uc131\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\ub824\uba74 \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc640 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30(\uc9c0\uac01) \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both\nworlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order\napproaches largely unexplored.\n  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable\npreconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1)\nalgorithm.

Workshop name: \"What is Next in Multimodal\n  Foundation Models?\"", "summary": "Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language\nModels (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for\na wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained\nembeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where\nstate-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated\ndomain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose\nvisual and cross-modal capabilities.\n  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve\noptimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the\npretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual\nlearning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization\ntechniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective\ncombination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet\ncritical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure\nreproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained\nmodels. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and\ncoarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach\nconsistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text\nalignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during\nfine-tuning.

However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic\ntoken level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between\nvariables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or\nsatisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce\ncausal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning\nframework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a\ndataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an\ninput question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated\nanswer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves\nthe causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on\nCLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces\nthe hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements.

However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which\nis a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely\nimpedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are\ninherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to\nevade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with\nvarying scales.

Recently, Implicit Neural\nRepresentation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction\nby learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling\nhigh-quality image recovery.

Experiments validate the\nsuperiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing\nTop-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/RH-Lin/E3RG.", "AI": {"tldr": "E3RG\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc815 \uc774\ud574, \uacf5\uac10 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 3\ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c MERG\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud574 \uc74c\uc131\u00b7\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569, \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac10\uc815\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ub85c\u00b7\uc18c\uc218\uc0f7 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 ACM MM 25\uc758 \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc704\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LLM\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uac10\ud615 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uac10\uc815 \uc2e0\ud638(\uc74c\uc131\u00b7\uc601\uc0c1)\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uac70\ub098 \ud654\uc790\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 MERG \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "E3RG\ub294 MERG\ub97c \uc138 \ubd80\ubd84\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574: (1) \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uacf5\uac10 \uc774\ud574(\uc785\ub825\uc758 \uac10\uc815\u00b7\uc758\ub3c4 \ud30c\uc545), (2) \uacf5\uac10 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9(\ubb38\ub9e5\u00b7\uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\uad00/\uac80\uc0c9), (3) \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131(\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\u00b7\uc74c\uc131\u00b7\uc601\uc0c1 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ud1b5\ud569). \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc74c\uc131\u00b7\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \ucd94\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7\u00b7\ud478\uc0f7 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge(ACM MM 25)\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc704\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "E3RG\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uba70 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \ucf54\ub4dc\uac00 \uacf5\uac1c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Current detection methods identify verbatim\nmemorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial\nmemorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond\nspecific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose\nForeground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric\nthat classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our\nmethod reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:\n(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of\nsimilar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend\nbeyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation\nmethods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local\nmemorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work\nestablishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion\nmodels, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and\nproposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "FB-Mem\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc601\uc5ed \ub2e8\uc704(\uc804\uacbd/\ubc30\uacbd)\ub85c \uae30\uc5b5(\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc81c\uc774\uc158)\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\u00b7\uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\u00b7\ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub274\ub7f0 \ube44\ud65c\uc131\ud654\u00b7\uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900 \uc644\ud654\ubc95\uc774 \uc804\uacbd\uc758 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uad70\uc9d1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc644\ud654\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud574 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uc5b5\uc81c\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ud589 \uac80\ucd9c\ubc95\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \ubcf5\uc81c(\ubb38\uc790 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5)\ub9cc \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub098\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uacfc \ud2b9\uc815 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud55c \uc30d\uc744 \ub118\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uc5b5 \ud328\ud134(\ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130)\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\u00b7\uc601\uc5ed \uae30\ubc18 \uce21\uc815\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0dd\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac04 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4\ub97c \uc601\uc5ed(\uc804\uacbd/\ubc30\uacbd) \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c(FB-Mem)\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131\ubb3c\uc758 \uc804\uacbd/\ubc30\uacbd\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c \ub4a4 \uac01 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640\uc758 \uadfc\uc811\ub3c4\u00b7\uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec '\uae30\uc5b5\ub41c' \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\u00b7\uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud574 \ud55c-\ub300-\ub2e4\uc218(many-to-one) \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uc644\ud654\ubc95(\ub274\ub7f0 \ube44\ud65c\uc131\ud654, \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30)\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uad70\uc9d1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc644\ud654\ubc95\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FB-Mem \uc801\uc6a9 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\uc5b5 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc774\uc804\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub113\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\ub2e4: \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\ubb3c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc720\uc0ac \ud6c8\ub828 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc804\uacbd \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900 \uc644\ud654\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\uc5ed\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc0c1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc788\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc804\uacbd\uc758 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad70\uc9d1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc644\ud654\ubc95\uc740 \uc774 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc601\uc5ed \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654(\uc804\uacbd/\ubc30\uacbd \uae30\ubc18)\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\u00b7\ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc644\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uac15\ud55c \uc644\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on\npredefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life\nscenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,\nthis paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly\nlearns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement\nlearning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based\nmulti-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect\nfuture-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is\nsubsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we\nincorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further\nenhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's\nresponses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two\npublic ESC datasets.

Early efforts to\nidentify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual\ncontent itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and\nfactually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to\nuncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced\nlinguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between\nLLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this\ninsight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction\n(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find\ndiscriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake\nnews.

However, LLMs perform worse in Common Sense\nReasoning (CSR) tasks when prompted in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi\nor Swahili compared to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Equalizing\nthis inconsistent access to quality LLM outputs is crucial to ensure fairness\nfor speakers of LRLs and across diverse linguistic communities. In this paper,\nwe propose an approach to bridge this gap in LLM performance. Our approach\ninvolves fine-tuning an LLM on synthetic code-switched text generated using\ncontrolled language-mixing methods. We empirically demonstrate that fine-tuning\nLLMs on synthetic code-switched datasets leads to substantial improvements in\nLRL model performance while preserving or enhancing performance in HRLs.\nAdditionally, we present a new dataset of synthetic code-switched text derived\nfrom the CommonSenseQA dataset, featuring three distinct language ratio\nconfigurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc2a4\uc704\uce6d \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\ud558\uba74, \uc0c1\uc6a9\u00b7\uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4(LRL)\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uace0\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4(HRL) \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc720\uc9c0\u00b7\ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.

We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that\nreplaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an\nONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL\nsamples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features\n(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),\nand requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers\nimmediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying\nNGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained\nobject earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against\nLRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial\nworkloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,\na 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from\n0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods\n(about 0.918).

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues\nsuch as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical\nbenchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By\ndynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework\nfundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the\nbenchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms\nof EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering\nwith algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to\ninject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can\nrapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and\nprecisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,\nEvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems\nthrough continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the\ncomplexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model\naccuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving\nthese evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to\nbypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect\nsolutions.

The task is framed as a regression problem, where the\nmodel assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate\nmultiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and\nretrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches\nconsistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of\ncontextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,\nwe introduce the \"Misery Game Show\", a novel gamified framework inspired by a\ntelevision format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal\ncomparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven\nreasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but\nalso the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified\nevaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional\nreasoning tasks beyond standard regression.

At inference\ntime, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no\nretraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving\nthe accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen\nLLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSCR\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9-\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \ub85c\uadf8\uc787 \ud48b\ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 API\uc5d0\ub294 \ud37c\ud50c\ub809\uc2dc\ud2f0 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc6a9 \ub300\uc5ed \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860\uc740 FAISS \uae30\ubc18 k-NN \uc870\ud68c\ub85c \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac\ub418\uc5b4 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucd08 \uc218\uc900 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud480 \ubcc0\uacbd \uc2dc \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9-\uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 25% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 LLM/\ubd84\ud3ec\uc678 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc218\uc131 \ubb34\uc2dc, \uace0\ube44\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1, \uace0\uc815 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc815, \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc2dc\ub3c4-\uc624\ub958 \uc804\ub7b5 \ub4f1\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\u00b7\ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc120 compact\ud55c \ub85c\uadf8\uc787 \ud48b\ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 API\uc5d4 \ud37c\ud50c\ub809\uc2dc\ud2f0 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud574 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\u00b7\ubaa8\ub378 \uc30d\uc744 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\uc870\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ube44\uc6a9 \ub300\uc5ed(cost bands) \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c '\uc815\ud655\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc800\ub834\ud55c' \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc FAISS\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub41c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c k-NN \uc870\ud68c\ub9cc \uc218\ud589\ud574 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud480 \ubcc0\uacbd \uc2dc \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucd08 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub428.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc218 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00, \ube44\uc6a9-\uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \ucd5c\ub300 25% \uac1c\uc120. \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 LLM\uacfc \ubd84\ud3ec\uc678(OOD) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uc694\uac74(\uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0, \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\ud544\uc694)\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871.", "conclusion": "CSCR\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9\u00b7\ube44\uc6a9-\ubbfc\uac10 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc218\uc131 \ubc18\uc601\uacfc \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ud48b\ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8/\uc9c0\ubb38 \ud488\uc9c8, \ube44\uc6a9\ub300\uc5ed \uc124\uacc4, \uc544\uc8fc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uad70\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub4f1 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \ucd94\uac00 \uc2e4\ud5d8(\ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4/\uacf5\uc815\uc131/\ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d)\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with\nnegligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and\ninfrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the\ndamage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with\npixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel\nWeather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of\n14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding\nground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm\ngeneralization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and\na real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean\nimages, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we\npropose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network\n(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.\nSpecifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep\nfeatures, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted\nfrom the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons\nagainst 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on\nWXSOD.

E-graph extraction is a challenging\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal\nterms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary\nperformance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,\ntraditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches\noffer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal\nsolutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We\npresent e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key\ninnovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data\ndependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded\nperformance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space\npruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only\npromising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving\nnear-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the\nreduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,\nguiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.\n  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis\nfields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact\napproaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art\nextraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost\nproduces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis\ntools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at\nhttps://github.com/Yu-Maryland/e-boost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c e-boost\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacf5\uac04 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30, \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ud574\ubc95(ILP \uc640\ubc0d \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574 e-graph \ucd94\ucd9c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc815\ud655\ud574\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \uc57d 558\ubc30 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1, SmoothE \ub300\ube44 19.04% \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud569\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uba74\uc801 7.6%/8.1% \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "e-graph \ucd94\ucd9c\uc740 \ub3d9\uce58 \ud45c\ud604\ub4e4 \uc911 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud56d\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 NP-\ud558\ub4dc \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \uc783\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ud574\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud070 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \uc18d\ub3c4\u00b7\ud488\uc9c8 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd9c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) DAG \ube44\uc6a9 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4, (2) \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub85c \ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd95\uc18c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uadfc-\ucd5c\uc801 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc720\uc9c0, (3) \ucd95\uc18c\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc218\uc120\ud615\uacc4\ud68d(ILP)\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc640\ubc0d \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8\ub85c \ucd08\uae30\ud574\ub97c \uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc815\ud655\ud574\ubc95\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uac8c \ud568.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\u00b7\ud569\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 ILP \ub300\ube44 \ud3c9\uade0 558\u00d7 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ud5a5\uc0c1, SmoothE \ub300\ube44 19.04% \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120. \uc2e4\uc81c \uae30\uc220 \ub9e4\ud551 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \ub450 \uc885\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ud569\uc131 \ud234\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uba74\uc801 7.6% \ubc0f 8.1% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0. \uad6c\ud604(\uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4) \uc81c\uacf5.", "conclusion": "e-boost\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud574 e-graph \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcd1\ub82c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 + \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 + \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ud574\ubc95\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc90c."}}

However, classical LRTR-based methods face\ntwo critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is\nlow-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with\nsignificant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete\nmeshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our\napproach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation\nthat semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics\nthan holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This\ndesign not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances\nadaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel\nasymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific\nfactor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized\nheads.

Nevertheless,\nour preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still\nhighly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely\nadopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of\nglobal trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the\nearly stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of\nMDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling\n(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning\nwith content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a\nposition-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a\ncalibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial\ntokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging\nbenchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that\nPC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more\nthan 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art autoregressive models.

By matching these\ndesign logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create\nreasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing\ndatasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning\ndatasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),\ncontaining 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,\nand Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging\nquestions from the web corpus.

To address this\nlimitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond\nto user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information\nof regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose\nRegion-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which\nincorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to\nutilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual\ncontent with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we\nintroduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset\nthat covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\\&P-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal\npersonalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free\nevaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the\nregion-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL\nmodels with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental\nresults indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding\nperformance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications\nin multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

To address this\nlimitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning\nsteps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses.\nThrough a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that\nnaively adding guidance delivers limited gains.

In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on\noperations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are\nincompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed\nSNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and\nhardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of\nbinary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic\nBlock (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual\nlearning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)\nmodule introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication\nand highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.\nComplementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further\nimproves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature\ninteraction across views within a spike-compatible framework.

However, a critical challenge remains: the\nsemantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their\ncorresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,\nwhere semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift\nduring SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale\ndatabases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL\nfirst performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the\ntables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.\nIt then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution\nDescription Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This\nreformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,\nleveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic\ndeviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain\nbenchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and\nscalability.

We challenge this\nbelief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices,\nrather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as\nharmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training\nhyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we\nreduce unsafe model responses from 16\\% to approximately 5\\%, as measured by\nkeyword matching, while maintaining utility performance.

Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal\nfiltering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,\nalternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as\nincorporating lagged dynamics.

In this paper, we\ntherefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with\nnoisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this\nend, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score\nfrom the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we\ndesign inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images\ninto a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to\nalleviate domain discrepancies.

However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of\nefficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an\nagentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement\nlearning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL\nenvironment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models\n(LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications.

Our key\ncontribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously\nestimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling\nprojection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a\ncase due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the\nbroader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy\nfor generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.\nAcross 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9\nchrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured\ntradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal\nevidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict\ngenerative capacity for related varieties.

When expensive high-dimensional\ndynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic\nloss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,\nhistory-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics\nfrom time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework\nusing the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by\nconstruction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a\ndiscrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium\nstatistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before\nspecializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable\nfor entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning\nstrategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on\nbenchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)\ncoarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while\npreserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed\nvideo of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local\nrearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics.

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context.

This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to\njointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from\nRGB frames captured from a single viewpoint.

Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout\nthe pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the\nrecovered geometry.

A key distinction between FL and\ncentralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically\ndistributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that\ngeneralizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper,\nwe analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent\n(GD).

Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of\npre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the\nmisalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the\nmodel's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction\nlearning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting\nthe conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we\nspecifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space\nshifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic\nconcepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a\nvisual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction\nbetween visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing\ndiscrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery\nfeature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies\nto minimize redundant forgery information.

We propose a token-level\nfiltering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware\nHLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based\nimportance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens,\nreducing LLM usage and communication costs.

Specifically, we design a memory\nbuffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling\nreliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy\nminimization of the physical system's \"mutual attraction\" between pixels,\nhelping to maintain image structure and coherence.

We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to\nevaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR\nsignificantly enhances problem-solving performance.

Existing research has mostly\nfocused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how\nto interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of\ncapturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and\nthe target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is\ncrucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic\nmotion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction\nlocalization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,\nbut suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although\ncurrent temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting\nverb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training\nand exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation\nmoments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed\nEgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric\nvideos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate\nhigh-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify\ncontact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide\nclosed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for\nobject masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot\nimplementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel\nbenchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric\nvideos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream\napplications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to\ngeneralise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual\ndata introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious\ncorrelations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of\noverfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this\nmakes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust\nagents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we\npropose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We\npropose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline\ndata to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a\ndiffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method\nacross both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces\n(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without\nrequiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We\nshow that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but\nalso significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel\nadditional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents\nin the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c, \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 + \uc7a0\uc7ac\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec Visual D4RL(\uc5f0\uc18d)\uacfc Procgen(\uc774\uc0b0)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc7a1\uc74c\u00b7\ubc29\ud574\u00b7\uc6b0\uc5f0 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc811\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba74 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6c0. \ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "(1) \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba3c\uc800 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, (2) \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uacf5\uac04(latent space)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc0b0(diffusion) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ucd94\uac00 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud480\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud655\uc7a5\ud568. \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378-\ud504\ub9ac \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c.", "result": "Visual D4RL(\uc5f0\uc18d \uc561\uc158)\uacfc Procgen(\uc774\uc0b0 \uc561\uc158) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ub3c4 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 \ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub354 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud568."}}

This\npaper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall\nconsists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers\nsourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These\ntasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,\nperforming price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing\ncheckout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague\nrequirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible\nproducts. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or\nShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple\nshops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they\noriginate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall\nrequire longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining\nrepresentative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline\nagents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and\nunderlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4).

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning\nhave significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,\nexisting methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial\nrelationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent\ninterpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,\nwe propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel\nframework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and\nmodels their spatial dependencies across the tissue.

Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth predictive accuracy and interpretability.

However, mainstream post-training\nmethods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary\nmodels and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the\nincorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking\ncorrect self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To\nthis end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a\npluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained\noptimization of each reasoning step.

A Reasoning Distillation Method via Multi-LoRA Interaction", "comment": "Accepted by IJCAI2025", "summary": "Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nstrong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of\nparameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical\nreasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show\nthat LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K\ndataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,\n12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRID\ub294 \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, LLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac15\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ub4a4 \uc5ec\ub7ec LoRA \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ucd94\ub860(IR), \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc131(KG), \uc2ec\uce35\ucd94\ub860(DR)\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc77c\uce58\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\uba70 \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\uc774\ub2e4.

The field of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create\nsuch explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for\nskepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is\nexplanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in\ncomparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,\nbut still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to\nexplanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method\nrobustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the\nrobustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for\ntrustworthiness.

This\nlimitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal\ndeficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To\naddress this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'\nunderstanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core\nstages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,\nwhere an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic\nunits and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and\nAdaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or\noptimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments\non the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and\nsubstantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all\nevaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like \"Text\" and\n\"Composition\". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators\n(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with\nInfinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline\nInfinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each\nDeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,\nhuman evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual\nquality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between\nhigh-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and\naccurate image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeCoT\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\u00b7\uba85\ud655\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801/\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud574 \uae30\uc874 T2I \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing\nmodels that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present\nFlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the\nstate of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial\nperformance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes\nto the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching\nformulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three\narchitecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:\nself-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion.

Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and\nprompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.\nInspired by the notion that strategically generated \"additional\" information\ncan serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective\nContextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy\ndesigned to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an\nLVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary\nreasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are\nintelligently integrated with the original question to construct a\ncomprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt\nguides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.\nCrucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning\nof the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and\nScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms\nestablished baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant\naccuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual\nunderstanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and\ncompleteness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the\nimportance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated\nperspectives.

However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output\ntokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the\nlogical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we\nobserve that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in\nproblems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,\nwhich we characterize with the $\\mathcal{V}$-information framework.

Existing methods\nunderutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby\nhindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to\nmodel the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI\nvolumes.

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the\ncreation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling\nshort of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint.\nIn this paper, we introduce \\textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic\npanorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control\nand synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN\nintegrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create\n360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a\nperspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,\nrespectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates\ncomprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene\nreconstruction, we propose a \\textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using\nmetric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our\nmethod ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the\nreconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually\ncompelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

This paper presents\nFedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs\nwithout accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a\nsimilarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the\nfull LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model\nperformance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment\n(ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM\nduring FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized\nsub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local\nresource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source\nLLMs across a variety of downstream tasks.

As artificial\nvision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:\ndoes AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article\nexplores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,\nshape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these\nmodels, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern\nrecognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as\npixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts.

While prior work has\nexamined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to\ncontact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using\nBlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and\ntheir summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,\nLlama, Claude).

We challenge both fundamental\nassumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel\napproach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the\nconventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text\nspace, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation\nspace and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through\nselective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic\nintegration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive\nimage-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves\nnotable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,\nVizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing\nexpected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text\nassociations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results\nprovide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not\nnecessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning\ntasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces\ncomputational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about\nmodality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal\narchitectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise.

We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements.

This\nnecessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational\nefficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive\nauto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting\nmodels struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and\nhave difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,\nhigh-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online\nensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale\npredictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of\nmultiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,\nthus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes\nthis with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean\noperational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on\nreal-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.\nIn online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an\naverage of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a\npredictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our\nmethod has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod\nAuto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30\napplications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine.

This version is a pre-MIT Press publication\n  version", "summary": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold.

Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to\n95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination\ncomplicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus\nphotographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical\nsettings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to\nlearn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a\nResponsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles\nacross the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for\npreprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification\nmodels. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local\ndataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated\nsignificant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by\n6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as\nDisparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable\nperformance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to\nreduce healthcare disparities.

Subject-specific ER can benefit\nsignificantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each\ndomain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and\nrobustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often\noverlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting\nsubject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific\ncharacteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a\nmulti-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on\nco-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities\nand multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo\nparticularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,\nsuch as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level\nnuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and\ngenerates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,\nin conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target\nsamples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only\nconfident target features are combined.

However,\ndirectly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is\nchallenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap\nbetween natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature\nAlignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo\ncolorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct\nprocessing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our\nprimary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two\nimages, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We\nachieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust\nto different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence\nto transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable\nstructure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving\nmechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a\nfrozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level.

Skeletons serve as a modality- and\ndevice-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action\nunderstanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and\ninteraction. \\RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and\ngeneralization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks.

This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense\nRepresentation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model\nfor skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a\nTransformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature\nDecorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The\nDSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial\nstructure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature\ndecorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce\ndimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module\nemploys both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.\nThe former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the\nimpact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the\nlearning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments\non 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,\ncovering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction.

While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for\nmultimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information\ndynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal\nChain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a\njoint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning\nstate is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and\naligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective\ncognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language\nmodel`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,\nand MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on\nbenchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently\nimproves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong\nbaselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and\nopen-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a\npromising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a\nscalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference.

However,\nsystem performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common\nin real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary\nlimitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately\nreflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of\ntraining strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers.\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which\nincorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker\nocclusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving\nmodel designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with\nsignificant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,\nOpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep\nconstraints between markers and joints.

Therefore, automating the design of SpTA\naccelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either\nmapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or\nsparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to\nsuboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A\nunified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,\nintegrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in\nthe design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \\times\n64} \\times Q_{64 \\times 48} = Z_{32 \\times 48}$). This vast search space\nrenders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm\noptimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor\naccelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a\nmore comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and\nsparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and\nevolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and\ndiverse design space.

Split learning (SL) offers a\npromising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices\nto a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating\ndevices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e.,\nactivations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the\nmodel training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient\nSL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive\nchannel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression\n(CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed\ndata to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the\nchannels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to\nshrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy.\nExtensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC\nframework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SL-ACC\ub294 Split Learning\uc758 smashed data \uc804\uc1a1 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud6a8\uc728 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ucc44\ub110\ubcc4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0e4\ub10c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00(ACII)\ud558\uace0 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucc44\ub110 \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654 \ud6c4 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub2e8\uc704 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc555\ucd95(CGC)\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud574 \uc804\uc1a1\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 SOTA\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9e7\uc558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc790\uc6d0\uc81c\uc57d \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 ML(\uc608: FL) \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.

As a fundamental\nprinciple, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains\n(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously\nencountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite\nsignificant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still\nchallenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on\ndeep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect\nshallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,\nleading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge\nof previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting\nhistorical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an\nappropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA\nprocess.

In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first\nframework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of\nindividuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a\ncoarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust\ncrowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and\nsevere occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based\nhuman motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The\ncore of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term\ndynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals\nwith similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous\nMotion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion\nsegments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and\nplausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization\nand rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no\nexisting well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual\nbenchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction\nfrom large-scene videos.

Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning\nis naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process\ntends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal\nthat samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,\nthereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This\nmotivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)\nproblem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning\n(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,\nwhich acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased\nevidence learning process.

Threat Modeling, that is,\ncomprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support\nto cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and\nallocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily\ndependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and\nmitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,\nthere has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack\ndescriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity\nof cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\ndeep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by\nleveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration\n(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five\nprincipal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,\nand Other.

In this paper, we present\nAdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV\nrepresentations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods\nthat treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement\nModule (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to\nenhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV\ngrids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial\nsubdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and\nbackground features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive\nexperiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves\nsuperior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming\nother state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound\nperformance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible\noverhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaBEV\ub294 BEV \uaca9\uc790 \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \ubc15\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uc81c(BG-RM)\ub85c \uc804\uacbd \uad00\ub828 \uaca9\uc790\ub9cc \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\uace0 BEV \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uacbd-\ubc30\uacbd \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uc870\ud559\uc2b5(IBCL)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574, \uc5f0\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 UAV \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc758 BEV\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4-\uc5f0\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 UAV \ud611\uc5c5 3D \uac80\ucd9c\uc740 \ub113\uc740 \uc2dc\uc57c\uc640 \uac00\ub9bc \ucc98\ub9ac \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, UAV\uc758 \uc5f0\uc0b0\u00b7\uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uc57d \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc804\uccb4 BEV\ub97c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc804\uacbd \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0\ub9cc \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud310\ubcc4\ub825 \uc788\ub294 BEV \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) Box-Guided Refinement Module (BG-RM): 2D \uac10\ub3c5\uacfc \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc804\uacbd \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc640 \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c BEV \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub9cc \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Levine", "Matthew Berger"], "title": "Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates", "comment": null, "summary": "Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to\ntraditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the\nusability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing\nfeature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three\nsimulation datasets.

In this paper, we investigate the impact\nof the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this\nend, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA\nto specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport\nutility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant\ncross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model\narchitecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the\none hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View\n(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most\nrobust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a\nnovel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which\ncan transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying\nthis approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors,\nmitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need\nfor new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles\nwith different sensor setups.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nhave enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the\nrise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven\nnews diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show\nthat this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level\nmisperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal\nreasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades\nthe quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts\nsignificantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To\nsystematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale\nbenchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of\ndiversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth\nverification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial\nevidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning\nconsistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art\nLVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and\nincreasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under\nadversarial evidence injection.

We study whether such\nreasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual\nand temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,\ndespite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its\nreliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial\nRepresentations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative\nsampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate\ntemporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex\ntemporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube.

However, in sparse-view scenarios,\ndespite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests\nappearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance\nartifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current\napproaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to\naggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real\nappearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance\nartifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed\nCo-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,\ni.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple\nrenderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.\nThe analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated\nas the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose\ntwo lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in\nsparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise\ninjection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and\ntheir effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks.

To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for\ninvestigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.\nCode: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore\nthe similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging\nissues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image\nsets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.\nExisting deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively\nadjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited\nperformance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines\ntraditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC\napproach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)\nnetwork to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature\nrepresentations of each image set and the distance similarities between\ndifferent sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep\nfeature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The\ndeep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn\n(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is\nexploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each\nimage set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by\ndeveloping a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function.

These views share a single ground truth (GT),\nforming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders\nadvanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as\nthey are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image\nis independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error\naccumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.\nTo address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented\nperspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency\nAugmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent\nconsistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented\nbaseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,\nwe introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency\nrepresentation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module\n(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware\nview through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module\n(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information\ninteraction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe\nmaterials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation\nmodel, we achieve a 70.6\\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2\ngroup-annotated data (5\\textperthousand).

However, several key issues remain. For example, existing\nmethods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in\nthe number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle\ncontent and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging\nmultiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent\ncontent leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both\nimage prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the\ndenoising process.

Building on\nthis insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic\nblock-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,\neffectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and\ntoward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments\non text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that\nS^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and\nother advanced guidance strategies.

However, many prevalent\nworks focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature\nextraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a\nmulti-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to\neffectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic\ninformation. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space\nvia a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the\nrepresentation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral\ncross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and\npseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an\nencoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR\npoints. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to\nmitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D\nconvolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point\naware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from\nLiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal\nrefinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an\nintersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel\nproposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with\nboth high IoU and classification scores.

Furthermore,\nit incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the\nchallenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images.\nTo enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in\nconjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to\nbe adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance\nwhile effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection\nbenchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark\nRealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD.

It can develop generalized representations or\nmore balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term\nknowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging\nincremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have\nachieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the\ngeneralization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it\nhelps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and\nrobustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual\nmethods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their\neffectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform\neven worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical\nsamples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a\ntwo-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on\nsequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,\nSEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized\nrepresentations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and\nbalance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation\n(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more\ngeneralized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD\nfor effective knowledge transfer.

During translation, it is essential to\npreserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate\nconsistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,\nan end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video\ngenerative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the\ncontrol of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified\npaired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we\nconstruct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic\nvideos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the\ncommunity, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in\ndiverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting\nsimulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the\naforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively\nunleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in\nsynthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.\nTo implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple\nthe learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a\ncomprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from\nthe perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into\ncinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground\npreservation.

Herein, we propose\nGazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that\nindividually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent\nattentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its\nhuman head predictor utilizes local information, while its gaze decoder\nincorporates both local and global information. Our proposed architecture\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget and\nChildPlay datasets.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and\nfixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal\nredundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion\ntransformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit\nstructured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads\ndynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,\ncross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods\neither impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a\nhardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive\ntiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via\ndynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity\nlevels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search\nalgorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention\npathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on\nsingle-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with\nfull-attention baselines.

The existing proxies often rely on\nlabelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.\nFurthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the\nconvergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the\nnetwork architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how\nchannel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a\nneural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and\nexpressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the\nrequirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage\nthe Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and\nthe extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a\nresult, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the\nlogarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature\ncondition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output.

Generally,\nMMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,\nmodality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.\nAccordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,\nlaying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a\ndiscussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and\nannotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on\ndifferent ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the\nauxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental\nconfigurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth\n(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part\nof the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an\nomni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),\ncovering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we\ndiscuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always\nguaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of\ninformation fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is\nbeneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the\ndistributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,\nrevealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal\ncategories when compared with RGB datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc2dc\ud2f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uac01 \uac1d\uccb4\ucd94\uc801(MMVOT)\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\u00b7\uc815\ub82c\u00b7\ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c \uc11c\ubca0\uc774\ub85c, 6\uac1c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc640 338\uac1c \ucc38\uace0\ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub978\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc2dc\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\uc801\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac04 \uc735\ud569\u00b7\uc815\ud569\u00b7\uc8fc\uc11d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\ud654\ud558\uc5ec MMVOT \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801.", "method": "RGB\uc640 \ubcf4\uc870 X(\uc5f4\u00b7\uae4a\uc774\u00b7\uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\u00b7NIR\u00b7\uc5b8\uc5b4\u00b7\uc18c\ub098 \ub4f1)\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\ub4e4\uc744 \u2018\ubcf5\uc81c/\ube44\ubcf5\uc81c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\u2019 \uad00\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ubcc4 \uc124\uba85, \uc218\uc9d1\u00b7\uc815\ub82c\u00b7\uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \ub09c\uc81c, \ubaa8\ub378 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ud654, \ud3c9\uac00\u00b7\ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac.", "result": "338\uac1c \ucc38\uace0\ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c 6\uac1c MMVOT \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uac1d\uccb4 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ub871\ud14c\uc77c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ub3d9\ubb3c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "MMVOT\ub294 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub2e8\uc77c\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc6d4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud488\uc9c8\u00b7\uc815\ub82c\u00b7\ube44\uc6a9\u00b7\ud2b9\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc720\ub9ac\uc131\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9d0\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00\u00b7\uc124\uacc4 \uce21\uba74\uc758 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing interactive world models depend on\nbidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting\nreal-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world\ndynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical\ncontext and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an\ninteractive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step\nauto-regressive diffusion.

Project Page:\n  https://mediated-reality.github.io/projects/yasunaga_ismar25/", "summary": "Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,\nhas made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for\ndemanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting\nhumans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has\nreceived much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and\ndense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed\nby human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding\nof the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to\nguide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect\nview-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated\nvisualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of\na scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image\ncoverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance.

Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced\nrapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches\ntypically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing\nunrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background\ninconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is\nthe lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and\nevaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the\nfirst large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically\ndesigned for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in\nbody shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent\nidentity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose\nOdo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive\nbody reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a\nfrozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from\nthe input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target\nSMPL depth maps.

A primary challenge arises from ambiguity\nintroduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing\ncorresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as\nocclusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit\nphotometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that\nutilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along\nthe epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we\nfinetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:\nleft-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the\nright camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right\ncameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit\nphotometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''\nmethod that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular\ndepth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both\ntraining and synthesizing.

This study\ninvestigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a\nstate-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated\ndetection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is\nconducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and\nRT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of\ncoastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves\nmarginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\\% IoU\n(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's\n0.810 and 0.606, respectively.

Action-driven video generation\nfaces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive\nactions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while\nagent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain\ntransferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we\npropose to \"render\" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic\nrepresentations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain\nadaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for\ntheir generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct\nskeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions\n(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of\naction-driven generative models.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX\noutperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability,\noffering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation\nfor generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "4DNeX\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 4D(\ub3d9\uc801 3D) \uc7a5\uba74\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc6cc\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud569\uc131 4D \ub370\uc774\ud130(4DNeX-10M)\uc640 6D(RGB+XYZ) \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc640 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubdf0 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 4D \uc0dd\uc131\ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc785\ub825\uc774\ub098 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud070 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 3D \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 4D \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ub300\ub7c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 4DNeX-10M \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uad6c\ucd95, (2) RGB\uc640 XYZ \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c 6D \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud45c\ud604 \uc81c\uc548, (3) \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 4D \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc7ac\ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\ub4e4(\ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815 \ub4f1) \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\u21924D \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uad6c\ucd95.", "result": "4DNeX\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 4D \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud574 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubdf0 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5 \uc7ac\ud65c\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub0a8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0\ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 4D \ub370\uc774\ud130, 6D \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c 4D \uc7a5\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 4D \uc6d4\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
